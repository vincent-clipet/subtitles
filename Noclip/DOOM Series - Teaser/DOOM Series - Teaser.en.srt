1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
So we were like oh the demons...well you land"

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,960
on Mars and you don't know it's demon  yet

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,019
and then you find out it's demons

4
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:07,559
and oh my god! and somebody even asks

5
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:08,580
"What do you think they are?"

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,769
and they're like "I think they're demons" you know?

7
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:11,830
*interviewer laughing*

8
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,960
That's what we did, we laughed!

9
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,640
Because we were like "That is ridiculous" You know? Who cares?

10
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,699
"They have pointy teeth...they might be vampires..."

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,099
And then you'd find our they

12
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,000
murdered someone or they took

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,559
something away from you, and all of it was

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,390
like oh my god...who cares?

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,789
The phrase "demonic invasion in progress"

16
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:34,710
is meant to.....we're saying

17
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,210
something to the audience were literally

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,780
handing them a ticket for a train

19
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,179
ride and saying "are you ready to go?"

20
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:41,920
Because we're going we're going to leave right now!
