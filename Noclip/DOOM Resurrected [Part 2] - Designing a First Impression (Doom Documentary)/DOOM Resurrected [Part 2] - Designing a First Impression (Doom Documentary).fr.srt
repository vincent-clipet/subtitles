1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,549
Je dirai que le début du jeu a changé,

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:04,798
significativement changé, 4 ou 5 fois.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,560
Le début d'un jeu est toujours ...

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,199
[[DELETE]]

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:12,178
On pourrait presque faire un documentaire complet

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,570
sur juste le début de DOOM.

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,839
On dit que pendant les 15
premières minutes d'un film,

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,119
l'audience est très réceptive.

9
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:25,768
Ils diront : "Ok, dans quel monde
vous voulez m'emmener ?"

10
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:27,479
[[DELETE]]

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,280
Like let's go there [[TODO]]

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,560
Take the idea that i am here to kill
demons and that's the story [[TODO]]

13
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:38,670
it's making a statement it really is [[TODO]]

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,350
about DOOM about what players want [[TODO]]

15
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:45,018
Et soit tu embarques avec nous,
soit tu n'embarques pas.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,420
[[DELETE]]

17
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,479
Les niveaux d'introductions
dans les jeux sont très variés,

18
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,188
mais la plupart suivent un modèle
qui a fait ses preuves.


19
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,169
[[DELETE]]


20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,570
Introduire l'histoire,
enseigner les bases du gameplay,

21
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,429
et définir le ton
de l'aventure qui s'annonce.

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,720
[[DELETE]]

23
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,429
La première impression est critique
pour la plupart des jeux.

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,930
Mais pour un jeu avec
un lourd héritage comme DOOM,

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,090
c'était encore plus important.

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,490
Non seulement DOOM était le [[TODO]]

27
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,798
latest game is series that defined the [[TODO]]

28
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,868
very genre it was in,
but it was also called "DOOM" [[TODO]]

29
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:27,688
[[DELETE]]

30
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,699
le '4' de 'DOOM 4' avait été abandonné,
en même temps que la version 1.0

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,228
Et avec tellement d'efforts déployés
pour s'assurer que le jeu

32
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:33,179
soit à la hauteur de sa réputation,
l'histoire a toujours été mise de côté.

33
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:35,789
[[DELETE]]

34
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:38,009
A vrai dire, l'équipe a eu du mal
avec l'histoire

35
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,719
pendant tout le cycle de développement du jeu.

36
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,209
[[DELETE]]

37
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:43,679
On galérait avec l'histoire, vraiment.

38
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:45,240
C'était le dernier truc ajouté,
car le gameplay passe en premier.

39
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,519
[[DELETE]]

40
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,200
Tous les niveaux sont là,
les secrets aussi,

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,759
les "glory kills" ... [[TODO ?]]

42
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,649
Et on se disait : "Comment on va foutre
une histoire là-dessus ?"

43
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:53,759
Vous voyez ce que je veux dire ?

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,079
Et comme je disais, l'histoire
gênait le reste du jeu,

45
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,908
car elle stoppe le joueur,
et commence à justifier

46
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,530
pourquoi il hait les démons,
et pourquoi tout le monde pète un câble.

47
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,909
[[DELETE]]

48
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,340
On dit que dans toutes les histoires,
les méchants doivent prendre quelque chose

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,750
au gentil pour que l'audience comprennent
que le méchant est méchant.

50
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,609
[[DELETE]]

51
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:07,170
[[DELETE]]

52
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,390
They took away Robocop's life [[TODO]]

53
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,119
essentially you know the the bad guy [[TODO]]

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,650
takes away his ability to be with his [[TODO]]

55
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,810
family. And you see that when he murders them. [[TODO]]

56
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,598
Donc on se disait :
"Oh, les démons... et bien..."

57
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:21,780
"tu arrives sur Mars,
et tu ne sais pas encore"

58
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,310
"que ce sont des démons."

59
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,810
"Et puis tu découvres que ce sont
des démons, 'oh mon Dieu !' "

60
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,539
Quelqu'un demande même
"Tu penses que c'est quoi ?"

61
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:30,199
Et les autres répondent
"Je pense que ce sont des démons ..."

62
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:32,969
C'est là qu'on a tous rigolé,
car c'est ridicule !

63
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:34,530
[[DELETE]]

64
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,259
Genre, qui ça intéresse ?

65
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:39,389
"Ils ont des dents pointues,
ça pourrait être des vampires ..."

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,980
Dans plusieurs versions du jeu,
il fallait plusieurs minutes

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,699
 avant de tuer le premier démon,

68
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,768
car en tant que développeur, on a l'impression
de devoir expliquer au joueur

69
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,408
[[DELETE]]

70
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:50,699
ce qu'il va devoir faire.

71
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:51,780
[[DELETE]]

72
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,519
Et même quand on faisait tester
le jeu à des gens en dehors du studio,

73
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,200
[[DELETE]]

74
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,628
on avait des retours comme :

75
00:02:57,628 --> 00:02:59,759
"Ok, mais c'est quoi la justification
de tout ça ?"

76
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,068
Il y a même un testeur qui a demandé :

77
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:03,780
[[DELETE]]

78
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,780
"Pourquoi je veux tuer des démons.
Vous devez me dire pourquoi !"

79
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,468
Ça c'est les questions faciles,
où on répond :

80
00:03:07,468 --> 00:03:10,919
"C'est un putain de démon !
Tu veux le tuer !"

81
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,078
Il y avait un niveau tutoriel
où un gars était devant toi,

82
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,760
[[DELETE]]

83
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,699
et t'expliquait quoi faire,
comment les choses fonctionnait ...

84
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,958
C'était horrible.

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,539
Ou comme Olivia qui fait un discours
devant toi, en faisant des allers-retours,

86
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,250
pendant que tu es attaché sur une chaise.

87
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,598
[[DELETE]]

88
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:26,938
Et puis on voulait que les démons
aient assassiné quelqu'un,

89
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:28,530
ou qu'ils t'avaient volé
quelque chose.

90
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,938
[[DELETE]]

91
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:31,469
Et puis on s'est dit
"Oh mon Dieu, qui ça intéresse ?"

92
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:33,239
[[DELETE]]

93
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,120
Every time we did something in a more... [[TODO]]

94
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,650
We added more exposition and we tried to [[TODO]]

95
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,269
explain ourselves a little bit more we [[TODO]]

96
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,938
tried to lead the [[TODO]]

97
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:43,949
audience by the nose or by the [[TODO]]

98
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,810
hands or something it never felt right. [[TODO]]

99
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,280
A un moment où on bossait sur l'histoire,
on s'est dit que,

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,530
ceux qui connaissent DOOM,
il arriveront dans le jeu en pensant

101
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,090
"J'suis ici pour tuer du démon !"

102
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,459
[[DELETE]]

103
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,799
[[DELETE]]

104
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,510
The exact same thing that the player is [[TODO]]

105
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:58,739
thinking, because there's always this [[TODO]]

106
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,870
idea that in DOOM the player [[TODO]]

107
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,060
feels like the DOOM marine [[TODO]]

108
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,310
Donc on va juste prendre l'idée
"J'suis ici pour tuer du démon",

109
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,310
en faire l'histoire

110
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,340
The beginning of DOOM 2016 was

111
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,400
really informed by where we were

112
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,590
with the development of the entire

113
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,388
game. And again this is

114
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:19,829
pretty far in the development. We're

115
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,810
talking like probably in the last year

116
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,019
of development maybe even less maybe in

117
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:25,479
the last nine months or so.

118
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,780
The story of the first level of Doom is in fact the

119
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,029
story of the team finding the tone of

120
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:32,250
the game. The combat loop of DOOM had

121
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,050
been discovered relatively early on,

122
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,728
we'll talk more about that in the next video,

123
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:37,918
but the tone of the game, it's wonderful

124
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,250
self-aware narrative, that  came much later.

125
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,779
It all started with what many might

126
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:45,239
consider an entirely disposable part of

127
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,400
the package. When Hugo and external

128
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,079
writer Adam Gascoigne tried to write the Codex.

129
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,719
Adam Gascoigne came in to help

130
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,870
us out with the writing

131
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,360
and Adam would would pitch

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,400
We'd give him that direction and he'd do

133
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,008
some stuff. I wanted

134
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,699
the Codex to be like a like a nerd Bible

135
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:07,228
like basically what you're doing is

136
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:09,149
you're a comic con geek going around the

137
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,888
world filling it with pages. So by the

138
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,329
end you could sit there and go through

139
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:14,409
it till your heart's content

140
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:17,218
I love that stuff, on Pacific Rim there's

141
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:18,060
a forum

142
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,310
and you know what kind of metal Gipsy

143
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,139
Danger is made out of and who made his

144
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,910
engine you know the Gundam universe

145
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,770
they just nerd out about that stuff i love

146
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:28,079
that shit. I could read that shit for days

147
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,209
[Danny] The original codex was a guidebook to DOOM

148
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,609
A sacred scripture for all things

149
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,520
DOOM but according to Hugo it was too dry

150
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,949
even to his geekish sensibilities so

151
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:40,168
Hugo did what he did whenever he hit a

152
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:41,519
creative brick wall

153
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,500
he looked to other forms of art for

154
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,569
inspiration. And for Hugo and Marty

155
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,400
inspiration came from the strangest of places.

156
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,739
Hugo is great with movie

157
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,209
references and probably one of the

158
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:57,659
early ones where that self-awareness

159
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,080
began to really take shape was "The Last Boyscout"

160
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,919
It came out a time when

161
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:04,709
the whole concept of doing a buddy cop

162
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,180
movie action movie with Bruce Willis was

163
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,340
so cliche because he we already

164
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:09,478
had lethal weapons and die

165
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:11,699
hards. And the writer I believe is

166
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,728
Shane Black I think he did an amazing

167
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:18,180
job in that he knew it was cliche and he

168
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,040
let the audience know that they knew

169
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,110
And and they would make

170
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,460
these little comments and I remember as

171
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:24,870
a kid it just made it all okay

172
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,840
It was so smart. Being self-aware.

173
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,879
There was this wonderful scene where the bad guy

174
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,250
Milo walks in and he's like you know

175
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,750
"We should introduce ourselves" and Bruce Willis is

176
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,250
smoking a cigarette you know this was when

177
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,329
Bruce Willis was awesome!

178
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,879
And Bruce Willis says "So you're the bad guy right?"

179
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,379
he's like "I am the bad guy"

180
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:45,500
"So I guess I'm supposed to  be scared or something like that?"

181
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,360
and he's like

182
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,139
"Yea something like that. I'll quake in my boots in a minute"

183
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,699
And as a fan I was just like this is

184
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,319
awesome you know because i was totally

185
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,418
ready for some super cliche scene and he

186
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:56,250
just took the sauce right out of it.

187
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,100
And it's this great moment in a

188
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,860
massive Hollywood, you know movie at the

189
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,720
time it was one of the biggest

190
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,830
I think it was the most expensive

191
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:06,659
script ever optioned at that time.

192
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,220
It was such a good example and again

193
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,960
Hugo through it out there

194
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,729
Yea, you can be really self-aware and

195
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,050
and make it work

196
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,240
[Hugo] we were like "Everybody knows!"

197
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,069
We know, they know

198
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:21,110
everybody knows. So let's

199
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,270
play with that let's say, what if the

200
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:26,689
corporation was totally, because

201
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:28,310
you're expecting the game to be like

202
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,889
"Maybe it's a cult, and it's a secret"

203
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,750
"and no one knows" but how about as soon as

204
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,399
as you walk in it's playing on a fucking

205
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,099
megaphone like "we need volunteers for"

206
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,780
"the Revenant program we're going to turn"

207
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:40,759
"people into demons!"

208
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,839
And the idea was

209
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,159
The idea was hell had already taken over

210
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,140
so you don't like you're talking to somebody who's

211
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:48,589
like full-blown nuts about something

212
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:50,000
they got that glassy look in their eyes

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,110
and you're like "you're really scaring me with the"

214
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,850
"stuff you're saying right now" so it was

215
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,800
a little bit of a play on.

216
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,710
Just being so 'out and about' with your

217
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:00,859
crazy that seemed very liberating

218
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,300
for me and for everybody.

219
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,889
Adam comes back because he would stay

220
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,620
with us for a couple weeks at a time and

221
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,240
I pitched him. I was like

222
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,550
They know. You know?

223
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,740
And they're proud of it because let's

224
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,240
say the demons have already...

225
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,740
...because hell influences everybody

226
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,240
so they've already become members of

227
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,790
the cult and they're not even aware of

228
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,080
how crazy they are. We painted this

229
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,329
scene to sum up the way it was

230
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,459
is that they have board meetings about

231
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,978
human sacrifices to summon the gods

232
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:30,259
or who's gonna donate their

233
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,450
hearts to the summoning of

234
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,310
the next barron and that they have

235
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:36,259
interns applying for this stuff and

236
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:38,389
there's posters in the lunchroom

237
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,788
mancubus programs and

238
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,168
we just kept going with it.

239
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:44,088
Adam is cracking up

240
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,250
and you know it's right when...it's very much

241
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,809
like being a comedian. You kind of put it

242
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:49,099
out there and see if the audience laughs.

243
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,589
So we put it out there

244
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:53,089
Adam is like "dude this is...

245
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:54,589
"this is awesome"

246
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:56,420
"we can do this you know?"

247
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,909
So he comes back and he's like

248
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:00,350
"I'm gonna take the first half of the Codex entries"

249
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,700
Because they come in stages

250
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,680
The first one you unlock on

251
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,359
the imp or whatever or the

252
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,190
facility, is going to be the

253
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,290
straight-line because most cults they're

254
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:10,759
kind of normal up-front. There like

255
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,529
"yes everything's fine it's about finding"

256
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:15,079
"yourself and no, there's not weirdness going on"

257
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,720
And then you get to

258
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,029
the seventh level, four years in and

259
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,579
you get handed the book and you're like

260
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,740
"this shit is nuts" like "what is going on?"

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,190
so he's like let's make the second

262
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,490
entry be like the black book that

263
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,830
only certain advocates can get and

264
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,200
will reveal the crazy to them and

265
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,700
The first one he gave me was the

266
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,470
one "curl up in a ball and basically kiss"

267
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,660
"your ass good-bye" if you get attacked by and imp

268
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,399
Dude I lost it! I'm like this is it

269
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,919
You found the gear, break the shifter off

270
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,449
we are staying here

271
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,580
And so he kept doing

272
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,830
that and it was like, slightly normal

273
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,660
corporate agenda,

274
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,449
oh this is the access to the black book

275
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,980
which is totally fucking nuts because

276
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,389
that was right about the time when the

277
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,919
whole story kind of fell into place like

278
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,679
literally that was about when from

279
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,439
that came "demonic invasion progress"

280
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,880
All this happened at the

281
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,320
same time because believe me our hair

282
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,940
was on fire because the story

283
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,040
still doesn't work and

284
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,360
[Danny] How much time is left?

285
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,820
oh my god....it'll make us seem

286
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,560
irresponsible if I tell you how much

287
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,120
time was left. And I gotta be honest

288
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,580
Our asses were our there, I mean we were

289
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,259
putting ourselves out there.

290
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:24,360
But why not? I mean when you're

291
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,830
when you're making something

292
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,720
i'd rather go down swinging for the

293
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,600
fences than bunting like fuck that.

294
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,460
Like who cares, i'm not hitting singles

295
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,550
like I don't give a shit

296
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:37,859
Home run. Go all the way.

297
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,570
[Danny] Was there a worry that you were

298
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,120
making a joke out of this,

299
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,830
I mean it's DOOM, people love

300
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,360
this thing and they've loved it for

301
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,129
20 years and then and you're putting

302
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:49,200
all this is in. Was there a

303
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,730
little bit of reticence like "oh maybe

304
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,259
we're doing too much with this?"

305
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:54,840
I think the brand was so easy to work with

306
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,480
it was like the most pliable clay for a

307
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,340
sculptor to work with.

308
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,320
It's DOOM. Every time we worried about that

309
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,970
stuff which is totally fucking valid

310
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,940
you look at the sprites going *vomit* and

311
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,800
you know what I mean?

312
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,500
[laughter]

313
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,279
We could do anything. I mean have you

314
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,199
seen the stuff that goes on in DOOM?

315
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,570
We'd just play a game and

316
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,090
I'm like, yeah he's got a rabbit....

317
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:19,899
Like who cares?

318
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,339
There's a rabbit on a stake in one of the games.

319
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,040
Let's just go to town

320
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,100
With a clear direction in mind Hugo and

321
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,870
the team went back to the opening level

322
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,698
with a hatchet. Cutting what no longer

323
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:34,740
worked and adding the flavor of the new

324
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,690
self-aware tone. What we're going to do

325
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,339
next is take you on a creative journey

326
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,800
through that opening level. Rising out of

327
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,078
the sarcophagus, grabbing your candlelit

328
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,539
suit, the glory kill tutorial, engaging

329
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,610
the first gore nest, and on a short elevator

330
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,399
ride to Mars. A series of rooms that can

331
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,409
be completed in a couple of minutes but

332
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:54,568
rooms that took the team every ounce of

333
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:56,399
what little energy and production time

334
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,139
they had left on the project

335
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,080
They say that the first 15 minutes of the movie

336
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,920
the audience is very receptive and

337
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,809
they're very open. They're like

338
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,399
"okay what world you want me to go to?"

339
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,078
Let's go there. You have about 15 minutes

340
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:08,849
to convince me to what the world is

341
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,860
And then if you break

342
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,990
that later on the audience gets

343
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,579
super upset. So we knew that

344
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:15,870
the opening, we treated it like that.

345
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,549
We're going to set the

346
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:18,990
tone for the whole game. It's an action

347
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,669
first game so the beginning has to be

348
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:22,469
action. If we open with a tutorial

349
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,730
where people are talking they're gonna

350
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,259
be like "okay it's that type of game"

351
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:26,818
So there's the little scripture in the

352
00:12:26,818 --> 00:12:28,349
beginning that says "may we never"

353
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,209
"need you again bla bla bla"

354
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,500
That kind of set the tone that there's

355
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,049
this biblical biblical force the DOOM marine

356
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:36,120
it's got that flavoring

357
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,850
and hopefully people tasted the cheese

358
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,159
There's a layering of cheese

359
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,958
to all this and we just wanted

360
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,849
people to exhale and be

361
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,649
like let's just have fun. Like seriously.

362
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,958
We know this is ridiculous, you know

363
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,388
this is ridiculous, good? Can we

364
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:52,740
shake hands on this and just have

365
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,350
fun? Cool. So it starts with that

366
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,389
little scripture and Corax Tablets

367
00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:59,159
which again the "Corax Tablet"s?

368
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,079
Like what are the Corax Tablets. I don't know.

369
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,660
They're just awesome

370
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,809
They're just sme awesomee text somewhere that

371
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:08,129
says awesome stuff on it.

372
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,769
Totally metal.

373
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,479
I grew up with that shit

374
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,860
My brother, big-time metalhead

375
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,300
mainly listen to the Iron Maiden stuff

376
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:16,679
some of the first drawings I ever made where

377
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,419
Iron Maiden album covers.

378
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:21,419
I remember the opening to Iron Maiden's 666

379
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:23,129
song with Vincent Price saying

380
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:24,419
"the number of the beast"

381
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:26,039
I'm like dude the game should start like this

382
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,539
this would be awesome

383
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,549
[Marty] One of the animators

384
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:32,669
Alan Rogers he was the one that

385
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:35,229
put the zombie there and then....

386
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,860
Just the little touches that he grabbed it and then *biting action*

387
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,720
And then you smash him on the table

388
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,220
[Hugo] Me and Marty are just freaking out to it

389
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,330
like oh my god that's awesome

390
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,180
put that in the game

391
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:46,159
All those little nuances that's

392
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:49,500
probably the best example of of just

393
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,360
when everybody just kind of starts clicking

394
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,019
[Hugo] And then as soon as you "land"

395
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:55,350
I love watching the twitch feeds because

396
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,120
the players are like "oh oh my god I'm playing"

397
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,829
Bbut that was good it was

398
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:00,958
like DOOM - boom! Right in your face.

399
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,759
Ruthless efficiency - that was

400
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,919
the motto. Say everything

401
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,929
with as little as you possibly can if

402
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,789
you don't care justdon't even look

403
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,139
at it. Don't even look at the echo

404
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,480
Who cares what that sarcophagus is...

405
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,100
In robocop, in a good action movie

406
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,240
the characters learn

407
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,360
They learn about who the hero is

408
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,679
by what people say about them or to them

409
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,049
so in Robocop when you're slowly being

410
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:26,729
made into Robocop which is one of the

411
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,000
most phenomenal sequences I've ever seen

412
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:31,199
Everybody knows it

413
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,149
it goes black and then they put

414
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:34,649
the lens on and all that stuff

415
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:36,120
We studied that and it was a big

416
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,980
inspiration for the intro to DOOM

417
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:39,939
And there's this great scene

418
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,660
Just the moments where he goes to

419
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:44,069
shake his hand and he crushes his hand

420
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,629
and she's like "1,500 pounds of foot pressure"

421
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,799
"He could crush every bone in your body"

422
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,519
And you're like "Robocop is just  fucking badass dude" and then the guy

423
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:54,149
goes up to him and he rubs his hand

424
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:55,708
and he says "You're gonna be one bad.."

425
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,168
"mother effer" ...

426
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,399
I just cursed I don't know why I said "mother effer"

427
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:04,199
Right there you knew Robocop is a badass

428
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,940
And the way that go into his

429
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,440
tracking and everything they just

430
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,040
indirectly are telling the audience

431
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,139
robocop super badass everything he does

432
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,278
is going to be awesome

433
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:15,328
so when you see him walk into that

434
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:17,069
grocery store and he just aims and

435
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,390
shoots there's all this subconscious

436
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:20,379
stuff going on of like "he's just not a guy"

437
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,179
Dude he's got a targeting system

438
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:23,539
it's fucking crazy you know like

439
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,099
Wait until he picks up that guy, it's 1,500 foot

440
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,560
pressure it'll crush his hand.

441
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,959
So when you woke up and the way they

442
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,190
were bowing to him. You're like "people bowed to me"

443
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,560
That's how badass I am

444
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,778
And I'm just sleeping

445
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:38,480
And later on when you touch the Slayer's

446
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,149
Testaments and they talk

447
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,679
about you like you're God I mean that

448
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,899
that that is basically that actor

449
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:46,610
leaning forward to Robocop and saying

450
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,960
"You're gonna be one bad motherfucker"

451
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,730
They're basically saying he's this

452
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,490
wrecking machine. We have to seal him away.

453
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,399
When you got to the

454
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,429
suit, and you walk out...

455
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:59,088
Giant Bomb wrote this great

456
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:00,560
article and listening to their podcast

457
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,088
and other people's podcast

458
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:04,820
I love when they get it. Because some people

459
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,350
looked at it and thought "this is ridiculous"

460
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,028
"Why is this thing with candles?"

461
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:09,759
But I mean, just let it go. Let's just have fun.

462
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,939
We knew from the very beginning we

463
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,950
wanted to show the suit

464
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,450
because we never really wanted

465
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,980
to go out of first person. We didn't want

466
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,389
to do third-person cutscenes and all

467
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:19,370
that kind of stuff so we wanted you to

468
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,710
really understand what you look

469
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,570
like and who you were

470
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,589
Honestly you need your characters in your story to

471
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,839
take the ridiculous seriously. It's ok if

472
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,430
I laugh at it - the audience

473
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:32,689
But when they're bowing

474
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,980
they're not giggling

475
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,159
It's very serious. It's kind of that balance

476
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,459
The area where we are the least subtle

477
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,560
about it is the whole

478
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,509
"demonic invasion in progress"

479
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,429
That's ridiculous.

480
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:46,120
It's absurd but there's a...

481
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:49,460
There's a self-awareness there that like,

482
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,920
don't pretend this is some

483
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,199
plague outbreak or anything like

484
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,080
that it's like, these are demons. Yfrom

485
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,330
You know is from the jump

486
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,220
That's what you're there to do

487
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,379
The phrase "demonic invasion in progress" is

488
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:05,240
meant to take, we're saying something

489
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,769
to the audience we're literally like

490
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:09,259
handing them a ticket for a train ride

491
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:10,519
and asking "Are you ready to go? Because"

492
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,359
"we're going we're going to leave right now!"

493
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,039
Forget it. You know they're demons.

494
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,720
I know they're demons. We both want to

495
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,828
shoot them in the face.

496
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:21,529
Let's just go. And then

497
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:23,449
when the guy comes on and

498
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:25,429
delivers the exposition, the rules,

499
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:27,500
like "Let's talk! I'm going to give you orders"

500
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,720
and you're gonna go push buttons.

501
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,039
And he just throws it away

502
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,359
We purposely wrote that in a

503
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,889
way that right at the moment that

504
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,840
the audience is like "fuck this guy"

505
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,679
and then DOOM Marines is like *push motion*

506
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,340
and you say "Nice! I was thinking the same thing!"

507
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:41,199
We want the player to know that we are

508
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,009
respecting their intelligence.

509
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:45,410
And we want them to know, that we know,

510
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,480
that they're there, to play a DOOM game,

511
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,460
and they're there to kill demons. So we

512
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,120
wanted to have this connection.

513
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,080
But at the same time it's a pretty risky

514
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,740
choice, you know?

515
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,660
It's a pretty bold decision to say we're

516
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,009
going to start some exposition like

517
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:03,170
every other game does and like every

518
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,180
player expects and then we're gonna just

519
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,070
throw it away. Literally. We're gonna grab

520
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,169
it and we're going to throw it aside and

521
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,110
is a player going to be okay, because they're

522
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:13,549
not making a choice in that

523
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:15,440
you know? We like to give players tons

524
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,730
of choices but this was one of the ones

525
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,230
where we basically said we're making a

526
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,730
choice for you and you're either on

527
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,259
board with us or you're not on board

528
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:23,059
with us. But that notion of

529
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:25,730
respecting the audience enough to

530
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,589
say you're here for a purpose

531
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:29,059
it's a little wink and nudge to say

532
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:31,279
we're throwing the story straight out

533
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,589
you know and and you're here to kill

534
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:35,769
demons so go kill demons.

535
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:38,220
You get the tutorial, you go through, you get

536
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,799
introduced to the first bit of arena

537
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:41,269
combat and that's really interesting

538
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:43,369
because we had a rule if you stand in

539
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:45,739
place your dead. So that imp room is

540
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,180
meant to teach you that like you're

541
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,500
skipping around your learning the

542
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,880
mechanics you're learning the imps which

543
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,230
is one of my favorites you meet the first

544
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,269
gore nest. What I love about the gore nest

545
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:55,519
is in a lot of games,

546
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,990
and we had discussions about this,

547
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,190
in a lot of games the gore nest would

548
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,809
be something you avoid

549
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:01,950
Like, that's the thing. Avoid the thing...

550
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,620
Oh shit I triggered the thing. And it starts the fight.

551
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:07,000
The DOOM marine is looking for a fight

552
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:09,379
It's literally like a t-bone steak. When he sees

553
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,560
that thing it's a t-bone steak and he's a tiger

554
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,980
Because he loves starting fights.

555
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,980
My favorite thing is to kill demons...

556
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,579
does this start that? Great!

557
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:22,069
When he goes in and he just rips it apart

558
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,929
and the blood pops out

559
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,060
there's this huge scream and BOOM

560
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:28,009
the fights off, but we were betting on

561
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,029
the audience that that was what they

562
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:31,759
wanted to do. We had 1 or 2

563
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,589
people say "oh well should i avoid these?"

564
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,359
This is early during tests and

565
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,129
we thought I don't think anybody who

566
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,200
paid $60 for a DOOM game is going

567
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,789
to avoid a fight.

568
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:42,980
And then when you walk through the hallway and she

569
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,620
says "We have to contain this.  You could ruin everything"

570
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:48,139
that's that subtle indirect storytelling

571
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,560
like just super lean. Very efficient

572
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,480
I love the idea that she would say he

573
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,980
could ruin everything because again it's

574
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,019
the robocop scene of him leaning in

575
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:59,059
saying "you're a bad motherfucker"

576
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:01,129
It's basically saying I'm powerful and

577
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,720
I'm feared. Which makes the

578
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,519
player feel powerful. And I just kicked

579
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,819
the shit out of a bunch of imps

580
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:10,099
And when you get in the elevator was just timing. To get

581
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:11,959
stuff to work in video game development

582
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,029
is not easy. To get stuff timed to the

583
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:15,829
point that when the elevator opens the

584
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:18,000
shotgun cocks and the music is right there

585
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,180
with the lag-this and the timing of that

586
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,799
and the framerate this and holy cow...

587
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,480
It's like literally three in the morning at

588
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,279
Jerry's desk and we're all

589
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:30,559
sitting there like pale like "the timing is off"

590
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,970
"we have to get this fixed"

591
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,080
This was Marty's suggestion when he glances down at the

592
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:37,519
body when the guy says "it was worth the"

593
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,079
"risk I assure you"

594
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,129
"clearly things have gotten out of hand"

595
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,560
and then he glanced down, I love that little touch.

596
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,599
The the button smash and

597
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:47,419
the shotgun cock is very much

598
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,710
him giving the finger to the

599
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,559
idea that this this was all worth it

600
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,259
It's not. It's demons .

601
00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:00,759
And i'm going to kill them all because

602
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:02,099
that's what I do.

603
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:04,259
[Hugo] I mean if I think about it

604
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:05,940
the textures broke in the glass,

605
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,710
then we fix the textures, then it broke

606
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,090
again, then there's no sound

607
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:11,490
It's just crazy.

608
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,660
When it finally went into the box we were like

609
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,580
"Don't breathe on it. It works"

610
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:16,699
"Don't even look at it!"

611
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,609
The opening level of Doom is a great

612
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:23,619
achievement in design. It does everything

613
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,479
on our opening level checklist.

614
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,490
It introduces the story, teaches the player

615
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,319
how to play, and sets the tone for the

616
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,970
adventure ahead. Once you cocked the

617
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,589
shotgun and walked out of the elevator

618
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:34,149
you knew what type of game you were

619
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,220
playing. And in our next episode we're

620
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,140
going to show you how they put all that

621
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,509
together. In part 3 we talk to the team

622
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,849
about designing combat chess and chat to

623
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:44,798
Mick Gordon about reimagining one of the

624
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,399
most iconic video game soundtracks.

625
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,779
One of y favorite things about

626
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:10,250
the intro is is it is a great example of

627
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,079
the teamwork that was involved in making

628
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,058
this because everybody from every

629
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:16,160
department contributed something totally

630
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,750
awesome to this it was just constantly

631
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,250
getting plused every time somebody put

632
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,230
their hands on it. We all high-fived.

633
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,299
It was one of the last things we did and

634
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:25,190
I think throughout any project you're

635
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,230
learning how to work like a team so by

636
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,929
the very end we were a team.

637
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:31,370
We knew how to get shit done and work

638
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:33,769
together and I mean as painful as was to

639
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,509
throw stuff out Brandon Souders who is

640
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:36,589
the level designer in the intro-level

641
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,899
was I mean it required an incredible

642
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,100
amount of patience but he was totally

643
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:42,469
down he kicked major ass I mean it it's

644
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,650
a huge credit to him the work that he did.

645
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,960
Movies, I love when they take the time to

646
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,730
put the juice into the character I think

647
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,829
that JAWS is powerful because

648
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,829
they spend so much time talking about

649
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:57,349
how badass Jaws is and they build him up

650
00:22:57,349 --> 00:22:59,269
and he's the thing and "oh my god" and so

651
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:00,710
we were doing that with the DOOM marine

652
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,990
I love when they do that like you know

653
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,759
when the hero pulls out his

654
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,379
special gunm don't just pull it out and

655
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,030
shoot somebody. I want to know that that

656
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:09,740
was made out of special metal that was

657
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,230
forged by some fucking samurai dude.

658
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,970
You know what i mean? And slowly

659
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,558
pull it out and the gleam off the thing

660
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:17,119
like that's really what we were doing we

661
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,619
were milking it. Building

662
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:20,179
up the legend of the DOOM marine.

663
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,900
And the level that Sauders had

664
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,800
put together immediately following that

665
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,659
i thought was wonderful and introduced

666
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,670
you to the secrets, a little keycard

667
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,410
action, which I'd love to talk about more

668
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,170
later, and I love that it all

669
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,090
ends with again that little subtle nod

670
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:37,490
You're just blasting through and he says the

671
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,069
rging about the 221 accident free days.

672
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:44,289
You're just like "we just caused a lot of havok"

673
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,719
and he makes that little comment

674
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,920
But it's just on the side you know it's very very much out of the

675
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:50,059
way but i think it maintains that tone.

676
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:52,490
That complements the fact

677
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,808
that i'm ripping people's arms often

678
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,099
beating them to death with it.

679
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:56,779
I think that's what felt right, all

680
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:58,549
the puzzle pieces kind of coming

681
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:00,859
together make like a DOOM experience
