1
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:13,969
Doom. To many it's timeless. To imagine

2
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:15,769
a world without DOOM is to imagine a

3
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:17,839
world without first person shooters. It's

4
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,368
one of the most beloved series in the

5
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:21,019
history of video games, and the studio

6
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:23,059
that created it id Software, one of the

7
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,608
most prolific. There's an aura of mythos

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,410
around id Software - the creators of

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,989
a genre, the masters of DOOM. The history of

10
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,789
its founding fathers has been told over

11
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:34,100
and over again and with an early catalog

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,739
including names like Wolfenstein, Doom

13
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:39,378
and Quake it's clear to see why. There was

14
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:40,878
a rock and roll style to those early

15
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:42,500
days of id that captured the adoration

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,988
of nineties gamers. Romero's hair the

17
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:47,149
ferrari 328, the Congressional hearings.

18
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:48,738
It painted the picture of a

19
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:50,750
larger-than-life studio full of young

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,149
men defining culture and doing so by

21
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:55,250
breaking all the rules. But those days

22
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,799
are gone, ghosts that both define and

23
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,959
haunt the identity of modern id. And in

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,579
recent years as more of the founding

25
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:03,500
fathers left for different shores the

26
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,149
studio's identity in the public

27
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:07,009
consciousness has faded. One of the

28
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:08,930
reasons for this is the recent blind

29
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,060
spot in the history of id software, one

30
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,950
that stretches from the release of Rage

31
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,868
all the way to now. A time when the

32
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:16,459
studio went through some of its hardest

33
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:18,950
days, a failed sequel, a buyout, an

34
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,659
internal power struggle. But to the

35
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:22,520
surprise of everyone the punchline of

36
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,920
this uncertain era was an incredibly

37
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,350
confident game. A refreshing take on an

38
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:29,208
old idea that seemed to do something

39
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:31,399
that many had assumed was beyond the

40
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:33,590
ability of id. To reflect its history

41
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,109
through a modern mirror, to marry the old

42
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:39,618
and the new. The story of how DOOM 2016

43
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:42,138
came to be is a rather messy one, so to

44
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:44,208
tell properly we spend two full days

45
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,609
at the studio interviewing the people behind

46
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:49,188
its various iterations. The goal was to

47
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:50,868
tell the story of not only how this game

48
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:53,028
was created, how they struke its self aware

49
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:55,248
tone and designed its combat chest. But

50
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,048
also to tell the story of what happened

51
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:58,368
for all those years.

52
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,468
So first we packed our bags to take a

53
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:02,269
trip straight to hell

54
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:03,950
Richardson, Texas

55
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,879
From a gameplay feel perspective we reference DOOM 1 and DOOM 2

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,219
you know in the dorms everybody was playing DOOM

57
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:38,780
Diving in for hours at the time

58
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,479
It was awesome. Everybody loved DOOM. They thought it was bad ass

59
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,840
Again the movement, the no reloading they

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,759
the no taking cover, those are all

61
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,310
fundamental elements of doom 1

62
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:54,819
and DOOM 2

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,680
I started with id back in 91 and

64
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:21,269
working on Wolfenstein 3d and then

65
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,658
we moved onto Spear of Destiny the

66
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:26,969
sequel to wolfenstein 3d and then onto

67
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:29,280
the DOOMs and the various Quakes

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,469
started off actually doing some of the

69
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:34,289
page layout stuff and then also doing

70
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:37,679
some of the art for wolfenstein and

71
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,930
then for a long time it was just Adrian and I

72
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,180
doing the art. The roles varied from

73
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,090
time to time, I moved up to creative

74
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,459
director on some projects, producer on

75
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,069
others but I still consider myself

76
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:52,048
primarily an artist. [new voice] I joined as an

77
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,500
employee in 1998 had done contract work

78
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,180
for maybe a year or two years prior to that

79
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,209
I had taken the editor that John had

80
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,000
written and basically, making

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,400
it usable for Quake 3. When i joined

82
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,049
as an employee effectively that was

83
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,049
towards the end of Quake 3 and we

84
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,639
moved kind of immediately into Team

85
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,280
Arena. In addition to the editor

86
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,139
stuff started doing gameplay and

87
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,370
just kind of everything because you know

88
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,709
there was 3 or 4 programmers

89
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,509
at best self so we all did a lot.

90
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,908
[new voice] It wasn't the necessarily the earliest days

91
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:25,560
of id but it was it was some pretty

92
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,509
early days, back working on

93
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:29,639
Quake 2, back when the company was just

94
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,769
10 people or so. It wasn't like anything

95
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:34,019
else and just had a ball.

96
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:35,430
Really, really enjoyed it

97
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,038
and worked through Quake 2, the mission

98
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:39,870
packs, the console versions of Quake 2.

99
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,840
Quake 3 Arena. was the producer on

100
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,939
that. it was very small.

101
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:46,168
it was the kind of place where almost

102
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:49,680
anybody in the studio would be a lead or

103
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,050
director at another studio.

104
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,370
It was interesting there

105
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,899
was just kind of a mystique to it.

106
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,698
You had that the plan files

107
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,740
online and that was kind of how people

108
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,780
would follow the company, or the musings

109
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,929
of the of the people who

110
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,459
kind of become celebrities.

111
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,528
The personalities within the company very

112
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:08,790
much defined

113
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,069
the company and you can see those

114
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:13,019
fingerprints in the games.

115
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:14,639
There was a bit of the reverence

116
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,759
and an attitude that you didn't see

117
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,349
in a lot of other games. It didn't feel

118
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,030
corporate at all and certainly when you

119
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,919
showed up at the offices it didn't feel

120
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,140
corporate  at all.

121
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,509
We were kind of known for being that crazy video

122
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:30,000
game developer in that big black cube

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,980
out on the freeway in Mesquite Texas and

124
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,319
you'd ride up the elevators and get to

125
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,819
the sixth floor and there was a sign up

126
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:38,579
front that said id Software - suits 666

127
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:41,189
and you'd walk in and meet Miss

128
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:43,589
Donna. The long

129
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:45,329
time id mom, she's been here more than 20

130
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:47,490
years but she sat at a desk with a

131
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,850
with a massive demon image behind

132
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,070
her. It was fun you know it was

133
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:56,040
fun to go down and visit and and

134
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,020
as much as I never believed growing

135
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,490
up in Colorado and then living

136
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,199
in LA that I would never move to

137
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,479
Texas, when they offered the job

138
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,100
it was like yeah - this is an

139
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,370
opportunity of a lifetime. And 17

140
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,009
years later it's still where I love to come

141
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,050
When Marty joined id the team had just

142
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,699
started working on the expansion pack

143
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,310
for Quake 3 - Team Arena. A game that

144
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,410
was spawned from the studio's addiction

145
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,810
two Quake 3's capture the flag.

146
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,579
There's a group of us that played it

147
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:41,279
I don't remember which map it was - the space map with

148
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,839
the really short things, with the bfg

149
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,349
up here. And we played that 2vs2 CTF

150
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,680
every day at five o'clock for probably

151
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,290
three straight years. I mean I'm not kidding

152
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,840
every day and he we called it

153
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,609
MOTU - master of the universe. Whichever

154
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,370
team won was current MOTU and it was

155
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,750
some of the best times we had

156
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,220
because we were still tiny like you know

157
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,800
10 to 20 people. Yeah really fun a

158
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,120
lot of screaming and yelling and cursing

159
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,879
and tons of fun. [interviewer] I was saying to Tim (Willits)

160
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,399
that's probably the fastest capture

161
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,409
the flag in video game history.

162
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,820
You can do it like, four seconds?

163
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,709
Yes it really is so you know playing that

164
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:19,529
often with the same teams when everybody

165
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:20,729
had their strategies

166
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,500
sometimes matches would be over just

167
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,199
super fast but it was super fun. A lot of

168
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,039
good memories.

169
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,120
After Team Arena the team moved on to DOOM 3, a game that took

170
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,260
the series in a more narrative direction.

171
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,269
That had the player fighting demons in

172
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:34,799
beautifully lit but often

173
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,199
claustrophobic corridors. The game found

174
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,729
an audience but many felt that it

175
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,590
sacrificed gameplay in search of

176
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:42,389
breaking new technical ground.

177
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:44,189
Robert Duffy was lead programmer on the

178
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:46,379
project a game designed by a shockingly

179
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,110
small team by modern standards.

180
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,960
I think we finished DOOM with around 19

181
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,209
people in the studio maybe low twenties

182
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,649
but it was mostly built by fifteen,

183
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,449
sixteen, seventeen, eighteen people

184
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,009
something like that. I like a lot of the

185
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:00,990
effects that that we did

186
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,970
Imps spawning in and we had the ability

187
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,280
to tie lighting to sound

188
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,289
amplitude.

189
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,610
It was the level of

190
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,410
craftsmanship that I think that we put

191
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,750
in the game. As a studio you know we were

192
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,930
honestly too obsessive with quality i

193
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,389
think - every pipe had

194
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,060
to connect up and the

195
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,968
whole driving force behind

196
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:26,538
the studio was quality and polish

197
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,068
A really fun project

198
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:29,269
[interviewer] it's interesting how when people

199
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:30,860
talk about DOOM 2016 they go

200
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,110
"Oh it's just like DOOM 1 &amp; 2" but in terms of

201
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,610
environments and structure

202
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,960
it's actually got a lot of similarities with DOOM 3

203
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,519
Yeah i mean the UAC,

204
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:41,120
the kind of heavy industrial feel

205
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,370
We do reference probably more

206
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,818
from a gameplay feel perspective

207
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,219
we reference DOOM 1 and DOOM 2

208
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,980
again the movement, the no reloading, the

209
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,870
no taking cover those are

210
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,419
fundamental elements of DOOM 1 and 2

211
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:59,809
DOOM three did a lot to develop UAC

212
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:02,838
as that evil corporation

213
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:05,149
it had a a weighty

214
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,490
oppressiveness to it in an

215
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,620
interesting way. It's still

216
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,990
one of my favorite games that we made.

217
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,139
After DOOM 3 we had started another

218
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,549
project that internally we called

219
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:18,948
"Darkness". We worked on that a year maybe a

220
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:20,899
year and a half and just kind of

221
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:24,620
figured - we weren't feeling it? You know?

222
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,639
As a studio we were still

223
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,680
independent and so we had

224
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,088
the flexibility and the freedom to just

225
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:31,699
say that this isn't

226
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:34,938
working out.

227
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:37,370
And then Tim walked

228
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,839
into my office one day and he was

229
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,209
like "big machines and"

230
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,549
"apocalyptic setting" and you know all

231
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,558
this crazy stuff and so that was

232
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,839
kind of how RAGE started.

233
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,120
RAGE was a brand new venture for id utilizing John Carmack's

234
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,698
impressive megatexture technology it

235
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:55,549
depicted a vivid mad max-style world.

236
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:57,588
One full of areas to explore cities full of

237
00:09:57,589 --> 00:09:59,930
people to talk to and even cars to drive

238
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:02,269
[Robert] It was certainly different than what we

239
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,188
had done - the wastelands were

240
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,808
kind of built in pieces for some

241
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:07,519
technology reasons but that was one of

242
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,250
the proving grounds.

243
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,629
It was one of the areas where megatexture

244
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:13,850
really shined and especially the ability

245
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,860
to stamp on it and kind of unique

246
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,558
everything up. Vehicle combat was

247
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:19,759
certainly challenging I think it's

248
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,379
challenging for most people that do it

249
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:23,720
to get it right and to keep a

250
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,230
shooter feel but yeah the outdoor areas

251
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,300
specifically on the

252
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:32,719
360 and ps3 - that much

253
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,089
visual fidelity, 60 Hertz we push

254
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:36,470
a lot of triangles to the engine so

255
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,899
there's a lot of lot of design art and

256
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,909
and technical challenges in RAGE.

257
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,769
RAGE wasn't the only project id was working

258
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,049
on John Carmack had hinted that DOOM 4

259
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:47,629
was in development at quakecon 2007 and the

260
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:49,070
game was officially announced to be in

261
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,290
production the following May. Then CEO

262
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:53,719
Todd Hollenshead suggested it played hommage

263
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,360
to DOOM 2 as I was set on earth during

264
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,850
a hellish invasion. In June of 2009

265
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,250
Zenimax Media the owners of Bethesda

266
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,528
Softworks acquired id software and

267
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:05,629
its intellectual property. But still no

268
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:07,730
images videos or teasers of the game

269
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,920
ever surfaced. Even after RAGE was

270
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,620
finished in 2011 and Carmack insisted

271
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,480
that even more resources would be put

272
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,700
towards the DOOM project. In fact over

273
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,410
the next few years the public was sent

274
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:20,389
mixed messages over the state of the

275
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,679
game's development.

276
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,799
[Marty] So the way we were  kind of structured for a while in the

277
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:27,528
late 2000s was we had a

278
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:29,958
team that was working on RAGE,

279
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,328
Tim was directing that. We had a team

280
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:34,879
that was working on DOOM - the kind of

281
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,850
campaign version - the past generation

282
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,889
of it. I was kind of leading a team of

283
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:41,899
multiplayer developers that were...

284
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:43,370
...we had done Quake Live and we'd moved

285
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,470
into DOOM development.

286
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,120
And that team finished RAGE

287
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,639
and we were big

288
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,079
We had finished DOOM with 19 people and

289
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:56,328
we were at a point where we had

290
00:11:56,328 --> 00:11:58,639
almost 3 full teams so we were pretty large

291
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,669
a lot of growing - typical stuff

292
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:03,379
every company talks about when

293
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:05,179
they grow the kind of communication and

294
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:07,009
and all those kinds of things that come

295
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:09,019
into play. So there was kind of this moment

296
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,588
after RAGE where I started

297
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:16,790
looking a bit more at DOOM and you

298
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:18,559
again like a long kind of a long period

299
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,679
of evaluation and adjustment

300
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,060
[Danny] The period that followed was a rather

301
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,819
caustic one for the studio and DOOM 4

302
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,320
one of its many victims. So it's

303
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,750
understandable that id have never really

304
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,759
talked about the game. For years DOOM 4

305
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,590
was the elephant in the room that id

306
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,540
never spoke about and as a result the

307
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,069
conversation around this game has been

308
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,830
dominated by a leaked CG trailer and a

309
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,110
2013 kotaku article that painted the

310
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,550
picture of a heavily scripted

311
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:47,039
military-style shooter. So much so that

312
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,169
rumor mill articles and message board

313
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,269
conversations often referred to this

314
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:54,809
project as "Call of DOOM". But are so many

315
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:57,179
lingering questions, what was DOOM 4?

316
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:00,120
How did it play? How had it informed the 2016 version?

317
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,310
I was worried that many of the

318
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:04,259
answers to these questions would be lost

319
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:06,179
to time with all the recent departures

320
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,919
but as it turns out the creative

321
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:10,139
lead on the project was none other than

322
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,019
id veteran Kevin Cloud

323
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,039
So I would say what we had done is we had

324
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:20,000
explored a direction and got

325
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:21,840
to a certain point and felt like this

326
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,500
wasn't really capturing what we

327
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,110
felt like was DOOM - was going to be

328
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,409
a strong DOOM and what the fans

329
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:32,639
would want from it.

330
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,230
[Marty]  You mentioned the term "Call of DOOM"

331
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,420
that has been thrown around. It was

332
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,789
much closer to something

333
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:40,409
like that type of game. A lot more

334
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,569
cinematic lot more lot more story to it

335
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,700
a lot more characters around you and

336
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,650
that you are with throughout the

337
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,689
course of the gameplay. Definitely

338
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,450
different setting - it took place

339
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,640
on earth you know

340
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,879
[new voice] Robert Zemeckis-y, Contact, kind of like

341
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,850
"if this really happened" -  now granted just

342
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,620
want to be clear - it was awesome. But it was

343
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,450
more realistic. It was more

344
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,480
about the the the global impact of

345
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,399
a hellish invasion.

346
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,289
[Marty] Unbelievable production value - it was really

347
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:12,659
good from that perspective but it

348
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:15,179
was definitely a twist on DOOM that

349
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:18,979
took it into a much more cinematic,

350
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,649
much more scripted type of experiences.

351
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:24,889
It was a reimagining of doom in a

352
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:27,230
way that was new. I mean it was

353
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,600
totally new. When you were taking

354
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,820
cover and you're popping up and shooting

355
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,399
shooting enemies. The  demons looked a

356
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,240
lot different

357
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,850
it took awhile to get into

358
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,470
actually fighting demons - you were

359
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,320
fighting a lot of zombie type

360
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,240
creatures early in the game.

361
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,490
[Kevin]  As far as the upper level creative

362
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,740
direction of that, it was me

363
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,169
driving that and honestly again,

364
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:53,328
taking in a direction that I didn't think that

365
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:56,088
ultimately the fans would have enjoyed.

366
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:59,779
as far as a DOOM fan. Just trying to

367
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:03,350
get more character interaction a

368
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,389
little bit more connection to the world.

369
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:07,639
[Hugo] As a concept i can see why they

370
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,769
went there because I would probably want

371
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:12,320
to explore that too if it wasn't a DOOM game.

372
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,680
Because to tell

373
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,620
a bigger story it sacrificed the

374
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,669
Doom Slayer and DOOM is about one guy

375
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:25,939
involved in big things and DOOM 4 classic

376
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,040
was more about the big things.

377
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,599
[Kevin] It kind of comes off like that idea you

378
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,399
talked about earlier. About how you

379
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,509
had the pinky right - You said you had a vision of

380
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:38,870
redoing the the pinky in doom 3

381
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,720
and in this new doom

382
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,330
they're very different but to me they

383
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:49,009
both felt valid. right? And i think what

384
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:51,649
ultimately happened is that

385
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:55,159
I was kind of taking it in -I'm not

386
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,209
going to say DOOM 3 direction it

387
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,410
definitely wasn't that - but

388
00:15:57,409 --> 00:15:59,509
conceptually I was taking it

389
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:03,080
off path and went too far in that path.

390
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,540
[interviewer] So I guess what was the sort of

391
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:06,769
impetus to stop it?

392
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:08,929
You know there's there's always

393
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:11,149
a thousand conversations

394
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:13,039
that go into some something like that

395
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,000
The biggest i think was that...

396
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,289
...I guess the best way to say it is it

397
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:20,659
didn't it didn't feel as much like DOOM

398
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:23,719
as I think a lot of us expected it to be

399
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,720
or hoped it would feel. It all boils down

400
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,830
to kind of feel and I give

401
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,879
Bethesda a lot of credit for sticking

402
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,740
with us through those decisions because

403
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,080
it takes a lot to stand by a

404
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,570
developer saying it just

405
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,740
doesn't feel right

406
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,389
[Kevin] Very tough I have to say. For me

407
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:46,460
personally very tough time

408
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,360
but you know in hindsight I think that

409
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,480
the studio and Zenimax

410
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,170
made wise decisions and ultimately

411
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:59,329
I loved DOOM, right? So I want to make sure

412
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,780
that it goes out every time as

413
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:05,859
something that the fans love.

414
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,629
There was actually a period of time

415
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,929
between the end of 2011, the

416
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,429
end of 2012, and right at the beginning

417
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:15,640
2013 where we kind of did

418
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,589
2 reboots or kind

419
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,679
of a rolling reboot of sort.

420
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:26,230
Took a step back and re-examined what we

421
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,449
consider to be the fundamental elements

422
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:29,288
of a DOOM game.

423
00:17:29,288 --> 00:17:34,920
We asked Todd Vaughn who's the VP of Product Development at

424
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,420
Bethesda from the publishing perspective

425
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,640
To come down and spend some time with

426
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,380
us. I think we were we were struggling

427
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,390
with an unwieldyness

428
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,059
of how big the company was

429
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:49,418
and some focus issues.

430
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:51,730
There's a lot of stuff involved when you

431
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,429
when you go through that process and I

432
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:56,200
would say one of the big changes coming

433
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,240
out of that was we need to

434
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,669
refocus the studio just on one project.

435
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:02,620
[Danny] In the years that followed the

436
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:04,808
team was shaken up. Todd Hollenshead and

437
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:07,089
John Carmack left the studio. Carmack now

438
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:08,889
works for Oculus and is currently in

439
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,509
litigation with id parent company

440
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:12,789
ZeniMax over an IP dispute.

441
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:16,149
[Marty] Change is never easy for some people

442
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,769
you always go through that kind of stuff

443
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:20,019
when you're changing. We had

444
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:21,730
people who didn't agree and left.

445
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,890
We had other people that

446
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,750
didn't agree and we let go.

447
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,019
For some it's it's empowering and for

448
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,970
others its demoralizing but it's just

449
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,650
what you go through.

450
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,690
It's like any kind of big

451
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,380
change in life or if you've ever

452
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,360
been part of a team

453
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,609
I use sports analogies all the time

454
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:44,319
if you're part of

455
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,159
the Broncos and they go from

456
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,140
one type of defense to another type of

457
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,000
Defense you know? It's like "I don't

458
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,910
"like playing in the 4-3 I like the 3-4" so

459
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,680
I'm going to be upset about it

460
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,210
Or you can embrace it and just be like

461
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,640
yeah I understand we've got

462
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,470
this level of expertise and we want to

463
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,180
head in this direction and

464
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,110
we're gonna do it/

465
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,209
[Danny] The team was also bolstered by new blood

466
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,890
Hugo Martin who had previously worked at

467
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,570
Naughty Dog was responsible for

468
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:11,490
designing the jaegers for Guillermo del

469
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,829
Toro's Pacific Rim came on as creative

470
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:15,629
director while Crytek's former

471
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,120
graphics engineer Thiago Souza came on

472
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,129
board as lead renderer programmer

473
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,620
[Robert] When we first rebooted

474
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,019
this version of DOOM with Marty leading the

475
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:26,789
project I certainly worked with him on the

476
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:28,409
original pillars. The multiplayer.

477
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,600
campaign. Snapmap pillars and obviously

478
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,029
always involved in tech. We were starting

479
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:34,680
to assemble the tech team came from

480
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,920
programmers from both RAGE and the

481
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,860
prior DOOM project and then

482
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:43,409
Hugo came on board and

483
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,230
at that time Marty and hugo

484
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,559
really started running with the

485
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,599
game side of things and my focus

486
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,059
really turned largely on technology and

487
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,919
the engine team and

488
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,300
figuring out how the

489
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,500
hell are we gonna hit 60 on the console

490
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,500
[Danny] That's a three-year problems to worry about

491
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,160
Yes, but it was a lot of fun, a lot of

492
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,250
good collaboration

493
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,259
[Danny] It's been long assumed that once the team started work

494
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,240
on rebooting DOOM they left all the old

495
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,549
work on the cutting-room floor but one

496
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,740
of the gameplay pillars of DOOM 2016,

497
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,410
the glory kills, finds its origins in

498
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,480
what the team referred to as DOOM 4 1.0

499
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,180
[Marty] No matter where you're at you're

500
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,740
always a collection of

501
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,450
everything that's happened before you so

502
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,700
it's been it's been said

503
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,039
that we looked at

504
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,839
this game and then we scrapped it and

505
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,119
you know we decided to do this and

506
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,709
that's a nice sound bite but there were

507
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,240
definitely things

508
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,339
that... I'll give you an example

509
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:43,889
The previous iteration had a kind

510
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,380
of a sync melee system

511
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,270
where when you got

512
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:50,039
close to an enemy you'd end

513
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,859
up in a synced animation melee

514
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:55,289
type of system that resulted in a really

515
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:56,230
cool death of the enemy.

516
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,390
You initiate this syncing of the

517
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,100
you with the enemy and then this

518
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:02,019
animation plays out. You would look at

519
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:03,789
that and think of glory kills you know?

520
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:06,039
But it was slow it was a

521
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:09,369
very deliberate, very cinematic way of

522
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:12,428
approaching that.

523
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:15,309
Even pre-full-reboot we've had some

524
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,720
meeting where we were like "you know this is cool"

525
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,970
It's just slow. Can we

526
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,950
make it a little bit more like

527
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,559
fruit ninja with demons?

528
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,000
Where these things are fast

529
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,569
The animators developed this animatic taking

530
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:30,548
the work and the ideas that had been

531
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:33,009
done there. The idea that came out

532
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:35,230
of this is push forward combat and so

533
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,240
they did this animatic of push

534
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,329
forward combat and the initiation of glory kills.

535
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:42,759
[Kevin] The thing that really excited me

536
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,129
about it is when we first started seeing

537
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,620
the glory kill system come together. Kind

538
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:50,319
of redefined first-person combat for me

539
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,569
really started driving it closer.

540
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:55,029
We had an iteration of that in the

541
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:58,269
previous game but I think

542
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,759
Marty and animation team and Hugo

543
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:01,990
really work together to come up with

544
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,000
something very intense and exciting for that.

545
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,410
So it was pretty cool to see that

546
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,700
come together and I think for me

547
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,250
personally that really energized the

548
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,769
project for me.

549
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:13,000
And again, that was a good

550
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,829
moment but it was to a great extent

551
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:17,259
built on a knowledge base that had built

552
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:19,839
up through the course of developing the

553
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,279
the first version of it.

554
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,710
[Danny] So let's dive into some of that stuff

555
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,509
What ended up being

556
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:27,190
what DOOM is.

557
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,330
The first time you showed it I remember

558
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:29,980
obviously behind closed doors at

559
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,679
Quakecon. First of all, how do you end up

560
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,090
putting hundreds of people in the room

561
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:35,829
who don't end up leaking it?

562
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:38,199
I don't know. You know what?

563
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,900
We will give you

564
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,280
some of the footage

565
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,980
so you can see. We have it. It's never

566
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,029
been seen before.

567
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:47,950
QuakeCon I always refer to as the

568
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,538
greatest home-field advantage

569
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:51,460
in the history of games. Almost our

570
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,229
entire team at the time was in the

571
00:22:53,229 --> 00:22:55,538
audience. I always say how lucky I am to be

572
00:22:55,538 --> 00:22:57,729
able to be the one to stand

573
00:22:57,729 --> 00:22:59,710
up and in front of an audience and

574
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,028
present the game whether it's at QuakeCon

575
00:23:01,028 --> 00:23:03,700
or E3. I am only a representation of

576
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,069
the people on the team

577
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:08,798
that even this here

578
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:10,450
I'm just I'm just trying to do my best to

579
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,359
represent the team we have here

580
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,668
I got to represent a team that was all

581
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:18,429
sitting in the audience and then say you

582
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:20,169
know what you guys? You just want to see the game?

583
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:24,608
And we're sharing this just with you. Tim just mention that we turned off

584
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:27,548
the twitch TV. This is just for you

585
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:29,019
we have a lot to share with everybody

586
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:32,108
outside of this room at a later date but

587
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:33,819
we want this to be special and just like

588
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:35,888
we want this to be special for you

589
00:23:35,888 --> 00:23:38,319
we want the first taste of DOOM for

590
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,298
everybody else to be special, too. So i

591
00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:41,950
would like to make sure that everybody turns

592
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,009
off their recording devices

593
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:46,239
Put those cell phones in your

594
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:49,028
pocket. Camcorders down. Take off the

595
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:51,819
Google Glass. Google Glass freaks your

596
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:54,230
friends out anyway.

597
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,380
As much as I want you to understand our

598
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,559
approach to DOOM combat. Talking about

599
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:02,210
it really just doesn't do it a lot of justice.

600
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,480
[applause]

601
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,319
So you know where this is headed right?

602
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,319
[applause]

603
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,240
The pictures are great but I

604
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,769
figured you guys

605
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:16,910
would like to see a

606
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,759
little bit of the game right?

607
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:09,199
That's great I think you like it! Awesome.

608
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,730
People refer to that as

609
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,610
the best moment of their careers.

610
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,079
You can have all the confidence in the world

611
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,298
in what you're doing but you just never

612
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:20,730
quite know what the response is

613
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,069
going to be. But to have a

614
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:27,509
big audience just cheer is the best

615
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:29,669
gratification in the world

616
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:31,528
I don't think there really any accidents I think that

617
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:34,200
we built what we felt was

618
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,120
really good. We thought that it paid

619
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,599
tribute to the original DOOMs and we

620
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,339
thought it looked amazing and ran great

621
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,379
and we just hoped that

622
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,500
players worldwide would think the same.

623
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:52,109
That was the story of how DOOM was rescued from the

624
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:54,269
depths of development hell but there's a

625
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:56,220
lot more to this tale. Tomorrow we

626
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,019
investigate how DOOM found its wonderful

627
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:00,359
self aware voice and the challenges of

628
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,038
making the right first impression

629
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,399
see you then

630
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,419
That doesn't mean that the game is dumb

631
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:25,519
because I think it's deceptively smart

632
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,190
and sophisticated it's just

633
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,740
easy to understand which is honestly how

634
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,450
things should be. I always compare it to

635
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,950
Apple products. pple when it's

636
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,090
at its best -

637
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:36,980
my son is six he knows how to use an

638
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,808
iPad you know that's that's good design.

639
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:40,819
Yet that thing is obviously pretty sophisticated

640
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:44,658
[Danny] Has your son played DOOM?

641
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:45,919
I don't know if i should say that on

642
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:46,429
camera

643
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:48,740
[Danny]  Well we know the answer then

644
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,179
He may or may not have played DOOM

645
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,100
He may have made it

646
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:57,419
to Foundry.

647
00:26:59,028 --> 00:27:03,169
He might be struggling with the shield guys

648
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:05,489
and his mother might be extremely upset about it.

649
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,980
this could be an ongoing problem in my house.
