1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
It wasn't necessarily the earliest days

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,379
of id, but it was some pretty early days.

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,160
You know back working on Quake 2

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,060
back when the company was just

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,599
10 people or so

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,990
[new male voice] I started with it back in 91

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,010
working on Wolfenstein 3d

8
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,020
[new male voice] When I joined as an employee effectively that was

9
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:19,559
towards the end of Quake 3 you know

10
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,689
there was three or four programmers

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,730
at best. So we all did a lot

12
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,980
[First Voice] You'd ride up the elevators and get to

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,480
the sixth floor and there was a sign

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,539
out front that said "id Software - Suite 666"

15
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,949
It was what you would hope. Everybody loved

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,570
what they did. Pushing the envelope

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,009
in almost every single way

18
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,039
From a gameplay feel perspective we

19
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:48,209
reference DOOM 1 and DOOM 2

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,009
[new male voice] It had to be fast because that was a core element of

21
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,149
DOOM - you felt fast

22
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,219
You'd look at the sprites going *vomit* and like...

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,469
You know what I mean?

24
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,149
Like, have you seen the stuff that

25
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:58,369
goes on in DOOM?

26
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:01,140
We would play a game and  I'm thinking "We could do anything!"

27
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,939
It was DOOM but something else

28
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,789
[new male voice] Robert Zemeckis-y "Contact" kind of...

29
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,580
....the global impact of a hellish invasion

30
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:10,289
[new male voice] Very tough i have to say for me personally

31
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,160
very tough, tough time

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,110
A lot of money is spent when you make something and

33
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:15,868
then you decide to move away from it so

34
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,879
we have to do this...we have to do this

35
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:20,179
and it has been great!

36
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,539
Our asses were out there, but why not? I'd rather go down

37
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,660
swinging for the fences than bunting.

38
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,760
You can be really self-aware and make it work

39
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,980
[new male voice] Because you're expecting

40
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:33,299
the game to be like "Maybe it's a cult...

41
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,299
"...and it's a secret and no one knows"

42
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:36,879
But how about as soon as you walk in

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,700
it's playing on a fucking megaphone like

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,280
"We need volunteers for the Revenant"

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
"Program. We're going to turn people into Demons!"

46
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,090
When it finally went into the box

47
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,680
we were like "Don't breathe on it!"

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
"It works....don't even look at it!"
