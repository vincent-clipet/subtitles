1
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,259
Since Doom mastered the template of the first person shooter over two decades ago,

2
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,740
we've been subjected to over 20 years of design iteration.

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,280
That doesn't exactly leave much in the way of new ground for the genre to stomp on.

4
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:29,719
So what do you do when you're asked to recreate a feel of a game that came out over 20 years ago,

5
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,500
While you're expected to have it sell in an incredibly unforgiving first person shooter marketplace?

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,760
The three pillars of Doom 2016's gameplay are:

7
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:38,419
monsters,

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,079
guns,

9
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,059
and level design.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,780
And today, we're going to take the time to look at how each one was crafted.

11
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,979
But there's another aspect of Doom that provides the fuel for your psychotic rampage,

12
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:51,899
It's extraordinary soundtrack by talented producer Mick Gordan

13
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,619
So we should probably have a quick chat with him too.

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,219
Today we get technical and dive into the design of Doom 2016.

15
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:03,640
It's combat chess, glory kills, curious level design, and furious soundtrack.

16
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,959
My name is Gerry Keehan.

17
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,780
I'm the lead level designer on the Doom project and the lead level designer here at Id

18
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:18,659
I joined the team back in 2003 during the development of Doom 3.

19
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,140
You remember delta 3? The teleportation level?

20
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,640
"Yes"

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,579
Yeah, that was one of mine.

22
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:27,140
Some of the alpha labs levels, delta labs.

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,260
The only ones I didn't really touch were the hell maps.

24
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:33,239
That was another designer.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,180
"What was it like trying to re-imagine a game like Doom?"

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,800
"Because you worked on the old UAC and there was a vision of what that thing was."

27
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,140
"What was it like 12 years later, almost like going back to remodel your old home?"

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,719
I think about this, like how did we get here.

29
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:57,300
The fondness of Doom 1, right? and fans, you have a huge fan base.

30
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,099
What does a Doom 1 game look like today?

31
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,840
Some of the things about doom 3 -  graphically fantastic

32
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,879
Doom 3 had accolades for how good It looked.

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,400
There was controversy, maybe even devision with the fan base

34
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,840
of horror verses fast paced, and it's like can you match those two together?

35
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,539
Can you do an awesome visual experience but bring back what was Doom 1 to people?

36
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,960
Well it was fast, it was fun, it was fearsome, it was crazy.

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,460
It was not like anything anyone else had played ever before.

38
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,159
then what does that look like, what game do we need to make?

39
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,659
That at it's core drove us.

40
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,080
[Danny] Gerry said the direction the team eventually went in didn't look anything like what we expect from most single player campaigns.

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,580
In fact it found it's roots in a multiplayer mode his team was originally testing

42
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,200
Before that part of the game was out sourced to Certain Affinity.

43
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,479
[Gerry] Ultimately, the layouts, the spaces

44
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,720
really is an evolution of that multiplayer idea.

45
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:01,780
The dance, the movement around the space.

46
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,659
The balance was striking a believable place to a multiplayer layout

47
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:16,500
So in res-ops for example, you get to what we call the Imp room.

48
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,740
What It looked like originaly was a box with some crates

49
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,559
And from there it goes to "Well we're going to start to do multi-tiers"

50
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:30,039
Because we went forward in a lot of levels and made progress in some of the hell maps

51
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,759
and places were there was a lot more verticality and over and under.

52
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,700
So then we revisit those boxes and say "Okay, how do we make this place just as fun"

53
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:45,179
But you have to tailor them back because you only have Imps for example or Hell Soldiers or whatever.

54
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:52,459
And so you have to go "Okay, well we need to make the space fit the combat we are going for and the type of AI we have"

55
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,460
[Danny] From talking to the team there are a number of terms they all seem to use.

56
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,020
They talk about "steering into ideas",

57
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,700
"Going where the fun is".

58
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:05,939
But the term I heard more than anything else refers to the driving force behind Doom's gameplay.

59
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:11,400
From it's level design to the movements to how you are rewarded with health and ammunition for using glory kills.

60
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:12,919
Three simple words.

61
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:13,659
Push

62
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:14,539
Push Forward

63
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:15,259
Push Forward Combat

64
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,180
[Gerry] You think about multiplayer, you're not backing up.

65
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,680
You're going forward to the next location.

66
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,620
"I see the ledge, that place is an advantage, I'm going to go there."

67
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:28,719
So that was in the mind of just about everyone.

68
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,839
The push forward idea was that we don't want to be scared and backing into a corner.

69
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,419
Thats kind of the picture, not necessarily that you would be, but stay away from that.

70
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:45,980
So how do we make sure of that? In things like the glory kills, that played into it beautifully.

71
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,880
Getting loot and health from the bodies.

72
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,680
It's like "Oh! go that way and get that stuff!"

73
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,720
because normally you end up with less health in an egagement

74
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,080
so it's just like go forward and do it again.

75
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,959
We basically used that as "Move forward because you are going to do more damage moving forward than you will going back."

76
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,799
It was one of the things that when we first started showing the game

77
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,340
at E3 or Quakecon or whatever.

78
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,379
People would comment on the glory kill and they were like

79
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,039
"Screw these glory kills man, they're going to slow down the gameplay"

80
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,560
And it's one of the things where you can't say it, you can't say "No no no"

81
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,399
But people are so used to the sync interactions in a lot of games.

82
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:33,879
I think that one of the best parts of the way the animatic played out and the way that they were implemented

83
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,659
like, right from the get go,

84
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,899
Is that you never felt like they were in the way.

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,100
They happen quick, and so much of the animation takes place after the actual syncing

86
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:56,839
that you get the beauty of the animation that you would normally have if it's like a quick time event or a totally synced event

87
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,699
But we take the player out of the sync so fast

88
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,659
You can be turning and they guy can be continuing his animation over here

89
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,240
So it never feels in the way

90
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,819
[Gerry] The design of the levels really played into that a lot.

91
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:15,519
One thing we wrestled with was locking you into a room and making you do it.

92
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,300
We tried to make it as fun as we could.

93
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,600
[Danny] "Was there a time where this wasn't the case, where you could just like barrel through levels?"

94
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:25,959
There were a few places like that and it does present problems

95
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,560
like what happens when I drag all of this AI into another room.

96
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,439
And then you end up where you're backed in and can't do anything.

97
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,280
So there was a concerted effort to try and pace those things out properly

98
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,759
We did have to lock the doors and not let you out until you deal with the situation

99
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,840
You can't have all the AI in the level chasing you through it

100
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,259
because if you put an AI on the screen, it's costly, it costs something.

101
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,980
[Danny] So the team steered into it, pushing forward at all limits

102
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,879
Into danger, utilizing choke points and open areas.

103
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:05,800
But the system was limited, as the demons were capable of traversing the environment with abilities far greater than most first person characters.

104
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,560
So they steered into that as well, and leveled the field by giving the player the ability to mantle.

105
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,379
[Gerry] The mantling came as a result of moving fast through the world.

106
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:18,439
We wanted it to be fast, because that was a core element of Doom, you felt fast.

107
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,019
Whether you were or not, but you felt fast, and that was what we want

108
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,959
When you go back you remember Doom 1, It was fast.

109
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:31,560
So that was like "Ok that's going to be our top billing, that's going to be one of our top core elements of the game."

110
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:36,199
So we wanted to kind of blow the lid off of level design.

111
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,920
in terms of "Well It's going to be this corridor shooter it's going to be whatever" like pigeonhole it into something.

112
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,160
We used it. We said "Now we have this awesome mantling ability"

113
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,260
"Lets just use it everywhere."

114
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,060
"Lets build levels. Secrets? Sure! I can mantle to get to the secret."

115
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,459
[Danny] While much of the game's combat is centered around these closed off areas,

116
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:57,379
there are some interesting set pieces that break up the flow.

117
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:02,399
The Argent Tower level, with its long bridge, was designed not only to teach the player how to double jump,

118
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,879
but also to teach them where to mantle.

119
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,360
There's an old trick frequently used in level design.

120
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,879
"Light leads the way"

121
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,920
If you're ever looking for the exit in an area of a FPS,

122
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,540
it's usually telegraphed by some sort of eye catching light source.

123
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,519
Doom's mantling system used a similar trick, by highlighting climbable surfaces with green LEDs

124
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,560
But sticking big green indicators all over the levels was a difficult challenge to overcome.

125
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:33,379
[Garry] That was a tough thing for us because, again, we're very art heavy, we love the quality and look of things

126
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,019
and you could almost not put anything in the levels that didn't look gaudy.

127
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,800
When you do that it was like "Well, how do we distinguish the ledge grabbable surfaces from the non-ledge grabbable surfaces"

128
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,620
and green lights ultimately payed off.

129
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,759
and it came through in a lot of the prototype maps, just like "we'll just put green lights here"

130
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,659
And so we were like "Well why not just do that?"

131
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,579
And it works for the most part, because for most people green is good, green is go.

132
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:04,919
So it's more of a phycological thing and so we tried to do it as naturally as possible so it wasn't too gaudy.

133
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,819
[Danny] Many first person shooters involve you taking on waves and waves of enemies.

134
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,040
Think Call of Duty, Battlefield, or Id's canceled Doom 4

135
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,840
You take on waves of similar looking enemies utilizing cover and pushing forward once an area is clear.

136
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:27,959
On the face of it that sounds like most FPS games, right?

137
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,259
But Doom works a bit different.

138
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,000
Doom is a game where you enter areas only to be surrounded by enemies.

139
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:36,500
At the start that's just Imps, lets represent those as pawns.

140
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,820
But as you progress through the levels, the game introduces new enemy types,

141
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,020
which combine with the ones you've already mastered.

142
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,660
The Summoner, who darts across the map in an instant.

143
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:47,179
The Hell Knight, who jumps around in close quarters.

144
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:49,479
The Pinky, who charges in straight lines.

145
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:52,039
What this creates is a form of combat chess,

146
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,939
where the player is in an enclosed combat arena with increasingly varied enemies to battle.

147
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,040
The further you get, the more demons you're tasked with slaying.

148
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:05,659
But against such increasingly challenging odd, how is the player expected to survive?

149
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:10,419
The player's massive load-out of guns, what's know as a hyperspace arsenal.

150
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:13,439
The weapons in Doom are rooted in the earlier games,

151
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,500
But with the ability to modify them to create entirely new ways of firing.

152
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,419
The team put month of work into creating a variety of modifications for each weapon.

153
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,860
The standard rocket launcher, for instance, had mods that allowed for remote detonation,

154
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,100
Locking on to enemies,

155
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,140
Charging for more explosive rockets,

156
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,799
And the ability to fire swarms.

157
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,840
Not every modification made the cut

158
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,059
but the ones that did created a thrilling arsenal of weapondry

159
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:42,219
That are as varied as the demons they are made to destroy.

160
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:43,519
[Hugo] The Imp is just amazing

161
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,360
He's the character you can just keep fighting again and again.

162
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,659
You get a room full of Imps in our levels with they way these guys set this stuff up

163
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:52,519
and you're just going to get good results.

164
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,540
Well they were the easiest, honestly. They were the hardest and the easiest.

165
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:56,459
Because they are a staple.

166
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,320
Consequently, they were the most robust, the largest amount of animations went into them.

167
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,500
So really we could put them anywhere

168
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,779
So we weren't limited in the design of the levels with the Imps.

169
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,860
They could go anywhere. They could do anything.

170
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,660
Probably, some of my favorites

171
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:13,439
Probably the Pinky. I love that he's this freight train.

172
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,260
There are times where I am in the last level of the game or any level of the game

173
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,159
and you're doing the dance and feeling like a rockstar and you're kicking major ass

174
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,240
and he just plows you from the side, just like  *freight train noise*

175
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,779
and you're like "Holy shit" ya know?

176
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:31,719
[Gary] He has again a limited animation set, but his role was he didn't have a ranged attack or anything like that.

177
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:36,819
He basically B lines it for you and you step aside, shoot him in the back because he has armor in the front now.

178
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,320
And we thought It was a fun game mechanic to be like "oh, okay if I figure out..."

179
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,439
"I could waste a whole bunch of ammo and get him from the front"

180
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,920
"or I could- wow if I actually do my double jump"

181
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,039
Because you have the double jump by the time he's introduced and you can double jump over him

182
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,639
or to the side of him and get him when he comes by.

183
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,519
I love that about him, I think he perfectly complements the dance.

184
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,519
And that's what it is. As you play through the game

185
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,720
You're playing chess, combat chess, the combat puzzle that you have to solve

186
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,080
and your tools and the amount of chess pieces on the board increase

187
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,940
and the size of the chess board and the type of chess board increases as you progress through the game.

188
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,680
The thing about the Barron is that he is the largest AI we have.

189
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,679
So his leaps are naturally going to be larger

190
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,900
All his movement is much broader and bigger.

191
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,580
So the space has to accommodate that

192
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,180
The Revenant is probably my favorite because he's so straight metal.

193
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,659
I mean he belongs on the cover of an Iron maiden album.

194
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,160
I like that he looks insane, because there's humor in everything.

195
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,200
I have a hard time, as you can tell. I try not to take things to seriously.

196
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,899
And I like to focus on the emotional response that you'll get from the consumer

197
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:51,579
Like when I show you something- I put a product in your hand, I put a new phone In your hand, we sit in a car.

198
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,779
You watch a movie that we worked on or play a game that we made.

199
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:57,059
What are you doing?

200
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,659
I want to see. Are you going like this?

201
00:12:58,659 --> 00:12:59,179
*gasps*

202
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,979
Well maybe we're making that type of game and we want you to be scared.

203
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,740
Are you smiling the whole time? Because that's how you should be on Doom.

204
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,920
Totally we wanted you to smile. We didn't want you to shriek or cover your eyes. Smile.

205
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:14,019
So when we showed it at Quake-con and you see the the Revenant, the Revenant just makes you smile.

206
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,659
Because he looks ridiculous.

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,500
He's loosing his mind, he's never not screaming.

208
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,300
It's just hilarious.

209
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,940
And he makes everybody smile.  To be honest

210
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,280
it is why we get away with the level of violence that we do.

211
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,519
Because it's kind of all okay

212
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,840
"It's all in good fun! I'm just gonna rip his arms off."

213
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,360
Ya know, like this is fun, we're having fun!

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,279
Because if it's just a little bit mean spirited, I think it's

215
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,019
tonally gets a little more harsh

216
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,379
and mean spirited and we didn't want that.

217
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,440
"Popcorn horror", that's what we called it.

218
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,380
"Popcorn horror: horror for the whole family"

219
00:13:54,659 --> 00:14:21,839
⛧ Rip &amp; Tear - Mick Gordon ⛧

220
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,200
While the music in many games complements and underscores the action,

221
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,820
the music in Doom is really front and center,

222
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
like a death metal orchestra playing to your every footstep.

223
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:37,459
As someone who loves music, but has absolutely no idea how the creative process for writing music even begins,

224
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,660
I was excited to have the opportunity to sit down and talk to the game's composer, Mick Gordon.

225
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:45,759
He had just arrived back at his home in Melbourne Australia,

226
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,120
after appearing on stage at The Game Awards the previous week.

227
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,639
The first question I had for him was "How do you even start to craft a soundtrack"

228
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,439
"for a game that is still in development?"

229
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,720
[Mick] The start of each project you spent this big time kind of

230
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,860
coming up some sort of joint creative language.

231
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,300
Where you're both able to use similar words and you both understand the same meaning behind those words.

232
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:10,240
If there's any ambiguity behind the conversation,

233
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,859
18 months later when you've got no time left, you're going to run into all sorts of trouble.

234
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,320
So it's important at the start of every project, we always spend that time

235
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,040
discovering each other's creative boundaries and what each person means.

236
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,699
So when somebody says "Hey lets make it really heavy", what does that actually mean?

237
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,540
Because heavy to them might mean something comepleatly different to someone else for example.

238
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,059
I always try to on every single project to have some in studio time.

239
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,919
When I visited the Id studios in Dallas, It was incredible!

240
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,659
I mean, you've been there.

241
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:44,019
The glass cabinet that greets you when you enter the office is amazing,

242
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:49,840
It's full of all those clay sculptures and things that they used 20 years ago to make the demons back then.

243
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,580
[Danny] It must be quite intimidating to try and re-imagine such an iconic sountrack

244
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,379
What was your creative process sort of starting this whole venture?

245
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,399
[Mick] Yeah, whenever you're working on a huge franchise like Doom its important to put that

246
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,340
that legacy on a high pedestal.

247
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,019
It really is, I'm a big believer in that.

248
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:10,799
I'm not a big believer in pushing everything aside from the past and then trying to create something new.

249
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,219
I think it's really important to pay a really strong tribute to that legacy that has come before.

250
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,939
That being said, If you focus on that too much, you're going to get very laser focused and become intimidated

251
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,960
and scared and loose your confidence with the work that you're doing.

252
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:29,439
So one of the first things we kind of did was actually just cross out the word Doom.

253
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,200
I just starting ignoring that word and said "what is this game all about?"

254
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,640
It is very much a modern first person shooter, don't get me wrong,

255
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,059
But it's futuristic, it's a futuristic science fiction, it very is.

256
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,840
It's set far far far off into the future.

257
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,200
There's obviously the invasion, the hellish invasion.

258
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,600
What does that actually mean? What does hell mean?

259
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,860
What has hell meant to different civilizations and people in the past?

260
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,240
Where does that come from? What does hell mean today?

261
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,059
How is hell being illustrated by Hugo and the team in this game?

262
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,860
What does Mars mean? What does Mars mean in terms of isolation?

263
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,180
Being away from Earth, planet Earth, Home essentially.

264
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:10,500
What does that mean? Being the only human left on a barren planet?

265
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,399
What does it mean to be scared of demons? Are you scared of demons ?

266
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:21,500
And through that process of looking at every single facet of Doom we kind of stumbled on this idea that

267
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,339
you're the enemy of the demons in the game.

268
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,099
Once we started looking at it from that angle it started to make a lot more sense and we were able to get away

269
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:33,779
from that Doom hang up in the past and find something that was new and original for today.

270
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,820
When I visited the Id offices and I chatted to Hugo and Martin

271
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:40,139
one of the big, big, things that everybody talked about was that they realy didn't want

272
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,780
heavy metal in the game, they didn't want it to feel like a heavy metal thing.

273
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:48,019
And I totally understood that at that point too because they didn't want it to feel like some cliche corny thing.

274
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,860
They didn't want it to feel like Bill and Ted basically.

275
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:53,599
That was everybody fear, to feel like a Bill and Ted game.

276
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,099
So we spent the first couple of months just experimenting with synthesizers

277
00:17:57,099 --> 00:18:00,319
and coming up with different synth sounds and seeing how far we could push synths.

278
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,720
And we did things like take synths and ran them through guitar pedals and stuff like that

279
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,900
to try and make them really aggressive and angry and play the role of a guitar

280
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,300
But it had a different sound and had a different sort of vibe about it.

281
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,040
And a lot of that stuff was heard in the original Quakecon demo that was behind closed doors,

282
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:19,180
but some of that stuff ended up showing up in the E3 Demo as well.

283
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:25,339
After that E3 demo the reaction from fans was "It's kinda cool, but it didn't feel like Doom"

284
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,779
And after that E3 showing we started incorporating a little bit more guitar elements

285
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:34,920
And once we started with 5% it started to feel really good and started to feel more like a doom game.

286
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:37,359
We started adding 10% and then 15%

287
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,640
and by the time we finished we had a pretty guitar chunky soundtrack in the end

288
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:44,180
The music in Doom- Its pretty front and center,

289
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,920
It's not like some sort of track that's playing in the background

290
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,340
A lot of the time it's not so much complementing the player as it is driving the player.

291
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,240
[Mick] I'm a really big fan of 90's video game music.

292
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,259
To me some of the best music that we have in the industry came from that period.

293
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:06,259
The stuff that went into the original Killer Instinct and the original Doom and Banjo Kazooie and Perfect Dark

294
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:07,799
and these sort of great games from that period.

295
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:13,460
One thing that all of those games really shared in common was that the music was really front and center.

296
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,740
You really knew the music back to front, you could sing those melodies back to front.

297
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,720
And I feel as we've progressed through the years a lot of things have progressed,

298
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,600
but music is not one of those things. Music has been pushed to the background.

299
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,000
So with this because doom is obviously a big franchise from the 90s

300
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,279
I kind of wanted to pay tribute to that regard as well where the music should sit up front and center.

301
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,659
The player should be aware of the music.

302
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,599
The music needs to play that sort of emotional pay off role.

303
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,699
It is the reward for doing well, it is the motivator. It tells them that

304
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,180
"Yes, you are OK, you are doing well, everybody's scared of you, you're the killer here."

305
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,759
And that's definitely something I try to do in a lot of my work is bring the music more up front.

306
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,460
Get people to remember music again, get people to enjoy video game music again.

307
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,880
[Danny] The soundtrack for doom is incredibly varied, and to be honest has quit a lot of music in it.

308
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,780
I asked Mick how exactly do you plan for all the various tracks that the game required?

309
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,460
So essentially you have the over all hierarchy

310
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,819
At number top you have Doom, so everything you do needs to sound like it's part of Doom

311
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:18,559
Underneath that we'd have 3 different areas that were lower in the hierarchy

312
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:20,240
One of those areas was UAC,

313
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,240
One of those areas was hell,

314
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,059
And one of those areas was kinda more industrial gritty lava based sort of stuff like the factory

315
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,879
so the sort ot thing you would hear at the start of the level.

316
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,620
so that's the beginning of the hierarchy

317
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,680
Under that you have all the different individual scenarios that happen.

318
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,320
So that spider mastermind for example, that's very much a boss battle so it's a bigger sort of track.

319
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,279
But it occurs in hell, so it has that sort of thing, that big part of it.

320
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,960
But It has that element of that industrial thing as well.

321
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,240
So we kind of start building within that hierarchy.

322
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,720
And then once you have that hierarchy decided upon, basically they'd sent me gameplay footage

323
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,940
And I'd sit there and throw it up on the television

324
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,480
and it's kind of weird, I'd throw the gameplay footage up on the television

325
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,420
and I'd grab a controller, and the controller's not even plugged in, it's a video, I can't play it

326
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:12,359
And I'd just sit there holding it, pretend I'm playing the videogame

327
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,440
Because that's my gaming space, I'm used to getting certain emotional reactions to video games in that space.

328
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,940
So while I'm watching the video and certain things happen within the video,

329
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,740
I get a feeling of where that music should probably be taking that situation, that scenario.

330
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:32,299
And I sit there with a little app on my Iphone and it's a little metronome app

331
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:37,019
and I just tap on that metronome, and that gives me a beats per minute that feels appropriate for that battle.

332
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:41,919
Then what I do is take that back into the studio, and by that point I've already got what the music need to do

333
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,380
and the tempo that it needs to be at.

334
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:48,579
At that point we also know where that situation is going to be occurring within the hierarchy.

335
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:53,440
So once we got all that information we can actually sit down and start building the track.

336
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,900
The reason I do it like that is because we got a framework you're able to actually work to.

337
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,880
If you just kind of went in raw or whatever without any idea, It's very difficult to come up with stuff

338
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,259
Usually we just kind of work on that stuff and send it over,

339
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:09,559
and then you don't hear it again until the game comes out.

340
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,199
I remember sitting here and I was working on something, I can't remember what it was,

341
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,080
but anyway it was a really late night and I was working up until 4 o'clock in the morning

342
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,540
and Doom just got released on all the digital outlets

343
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:26,480
and while I was working away I had a couple of twitch streamers up and they were playing through it.

344
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,659
And a that point you have no idea whether the music that you've done for the game is actually good or not.

345
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,340
You really have no idea.

346
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,079
It's all just a fly by the seat of the pants type of thing for the whole 18 months, you just rush rush rush.

347
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,400
And I remember watching one of these Twitch streamers, and he got up to the second level

348
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,380
and his head started bopping when the music came on

349
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,880
I was like "Ahhh! I think this thing might turn out okay, I think it might be alright."

350
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,500
[Danny] During my time on the project, talking to the people behind Doom 2016,

351
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,299
I feel like I have a much clearer understanding of the type of company Id Software is.

352
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,540
This isn't a massive studio with hundreds of employees pumping out games every year.

353
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,440
Nor is it a cocky indie start up, with ego's battling for attention

354
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,940
Id is a place where people work together closely.

355
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,539
Where talent, passion, and expertise is valued.

356
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:21,839
Where collaboration thrives, and the finger prints of every team member can be felt in the final creation.

357
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:24,459
This Doom meant a lot to a lot of people.

358
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,919
For fans it was phoenix from the nostalgic flames.

359
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,300
To critics, one of the best games of the year.

360
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:33,200
But to the people who work at Id, Doom was much more.

361
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,539
It was a battleground, one that they walked away from stronger, more unified, more confident than ever.

362
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:42,180
And for those of us who like to play games with Id Software written on the box,

363
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:44,740
That should be very exciting indeed.

364
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,700
Thank you so much for Watching Doom Resurrected.
