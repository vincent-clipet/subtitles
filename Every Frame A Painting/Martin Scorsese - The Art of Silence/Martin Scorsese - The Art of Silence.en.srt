00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,240
Hi my name is Tony and this is Every
Frame a Painting. Let's take a drive.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,809
Today’s subject is Martin Scorsese
and the art of silence.

3
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:15,780
Even though Scorsese is famous for his
use of music, one of his best traits

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,940
is actually his deliberate and
powerful use of silence.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,109
In interviews he’s credited Frank Warner
for helping him do this on Raging Bull.

6
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,090
<i>--After a while, we had so many sound
effects, we always talked about pulling</i>

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,490
<i>them out of the track and
letting things go silent.</i>

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,910
<i>Again, like a numbing effect as if you
were hit in the ear too many times.</i>

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,809
Here’s a famous moment where
Jake LaMotta sets himself up

10
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:37,870
almost a religious slaughter.

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,789
If you go through Scorsese’s filmography
there are lots of interesting variations

12
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,050
on this concept. And you can actually
compare him directly to others.

13
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,930
For instance, in the original
Infernal Affairs,

14
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,850
this crucial story moment
plays with music.

15
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,850
But for the remake

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,700
Regardless of which one you prefer,
there’s a full course of study material

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,900
if you watch and compare these two films

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,700
Sometimes, Scorsese builds the
entire film to a climax of sound

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,160
and then silence. This example is
actually kinda extreme because

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,990
the loudest moment in the entire movie
is immediately followed by the quietest.

21
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,750
Other times the silence is the central
dramatic beat of the scene. Famously:

22
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,930
<i>--How the fuck am I funny? What the fuck
is so funny about me? Tell me.</i>

23
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,930
<i>Tell me what's funny.</i>

24
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,119
<i>--Get the fuck outta here, Tommy.</i>
If you go back through fifty years of

25
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,210
his career, you'll actually find a lot
of fascinating ways of using silence

26
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,170
to heighten the subjectivity of a moment
to make a creepy scene even creepier

27
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,649
to show us love at first sight

28
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:09,269
and to bring our happiness
to a screeching halt.

29
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:15,870
Well, maybe not a total halt.

30
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,489
<i>--I'm not leaving</i>

31
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:21,840
<i>--I'm not fucking leaving</i>

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,019
I think best of all, these sound design
choices derive from character.

33
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:31,709
The characters are all making important
choices that will have consequences:

34
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,080
choosing to take the money
choosing not to fight back,

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,769
choosing to hide their emotions
choosing not to trust someone,

36
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,650
choosing to wait out the discomfort

37
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,000
choosing to get back in the game
choosing to ignore that

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,500
they aren't wanted.

39
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,989
And because these moments are repeated
sparingly and deliberately in each movie

40
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:49,970
the silence feels different
and it’s tied to a different theme.

41
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,799
It also lets Scorsese build a cinematic
structure around the use of sound.

42
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:58,060
For instance, in Raging Bull, almost
every fight scene is actually preceded

43
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,200
by a quieter domestic moment.

44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,350
This lets him do certain things
like harsh cuts into punches.

45
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,620
But it also underscores the theme of
the film, which is that the violence

46
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,910
in the ring is just an extension
of the violence at home.

47
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,109
By the time he’s attacking his brother,
you actually hear the same sounds

48
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,950
that you heard in the ring.

49
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,709
And it’s not just Scorsese who does
this kind of cinematic structure.

50
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,010
For instance, Saving Private Ryan is
bookended by two long battles.

51
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,190
And in each battle,
we get moment like this.

52
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,470
At the beginning, we don’t know
any of these people.

53
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,389
At the end, we know all of them.

54
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,579
Now, you might disagree
with my interpretation here,

55
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:40,340
but I’m convinced this character knows
he’s going to die, and in both moments,

56
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,760
he’s accepting that and
continuing to fight.

57
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,440
And I think it's a great example using
sound as an overall cinematic structure

58
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,190
for the whole film.

59
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,859
I do want to point out, this stuff isn’t
just a matter of good sound mixing

60
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:54,510
though there is that. The sound mixers
can’t do this stuff if you design the

61
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,540
movie with wall-to-wall
dialogue, effects and music.

62
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,269
<i>--I don't have anything
against a film being loud</i>

63
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:06,930
<i>for a moment or two or a short period of
time. I think that's appropriate</i>

64
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,359
<i>but if you have a sequence that's loud
for 20 or 30 minutes</i>

65
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,040
<i>you've forgotten what it's like
to be quiet and so</i>

66
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,540
<i>nothing really seems loud because
everything is loud.</i>

67
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,048
In popular cinema, writers and directors
have moved away from having

68
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,479
any silence at all, or misusing
the silence they do have.

69
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,110
And this is something that gets
appreciably worse each year.

70
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,110
Consider. 1978.

71
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,350
You might find that a bit cheesy,
but at least this movie is willing

72
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,350
to use silence to make us
feel the character’s loss.

73
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,600
And it’s willing to stay with him
through that entire silence.

74
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,960
Meanwhile, in 2013

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,460
This might seem silent but
there’s always music underneath.

76
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,789
More importantly the “not-quite-silence”
is used to reward the character:

77
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,560
he murders someone and gets a hug.
But if you watch the whole movie

78
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,759
literally ever time there’s silence,
he gets a hug.

79
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,229
So consider your silences
and deploy them deliberately.

80
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,479
Don’t cheapen them by overusing
them for any dramatic scene.

81
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,550
If you can build the film, structure it,
so that the silence derives

82
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,990
from your characters and what
they’re feeling, then you get

83
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,150
something better than just
silence: an emotional reaction

84
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,220
<i>--Which would be worse?</i>

85
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:38,220
<i>To live as a monster or
to die as a good man?</i>

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,370
<i>--Teddy?</i>
