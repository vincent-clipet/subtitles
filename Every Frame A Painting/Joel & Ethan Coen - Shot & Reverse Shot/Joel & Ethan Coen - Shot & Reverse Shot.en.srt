00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,400
Hi my name is Tony
and this is Every Frame a Painting

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,100
The most basic thing we have
in film grammar is probably this:

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,799
Shot

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,520
Reverse shot

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,300
Nearly everything you watch
is going to be

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,100
Nearly everything you watch
is going to be filled with it.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,300
And most filmmakers seem to use it
as a quick way to record dialogue.

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,000
Keep the actors still,
use multiple cameras

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,000
shoot ten takes,
and then make decisions in post.

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,400
But I think shot | reverse shot is still
powerful when it's done precisely

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
And a good example of that
is the work of Joel & Ethan Coen.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
-"We thought you was..."

13
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,000
-"...a toad."

14
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,329
Because the Coens are
masters of the dialogue scene

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,200
And they’ve done it by
keeping their shots simple but precise

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,370
-"Can I share something with you?"

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,300
So today, let’s reconsider
shot | reverse shot.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,700
What can we learn from
the way the Coens use it?

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,000
-"But let me ask you a question..."

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,200
-"Would an imbecile come up with this?"

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,660
One of the first things
you notice about the Coens is that

22
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,310
they like to film dialogue from
inside the space of the conversation.

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,759
And that means the camera is
usually in between the two characters

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,460
so that they each get separate shots.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,100
-"Do I make myself clear?"

26
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,100
In other words,
they shoot a lot of singles.

27
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,220
-"I’m sorry. I wasn’t listening."

28
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,500
Other filmmakers, like Paul Greengrass,
prefer the camera behind the characters

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,200
Usually on a very long lens,
so you feel like you’re spying

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,000
-"I want to know what happened"
-"What happened?"

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,400
-"Jason Bourne happened.
You got the files."

32
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,000
-"Then let’s cut the crap."

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,500
The Coens and Roger Deakins
don’t do this.

34
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,500
In fact, they film
almost exclusively on wide lenses

35
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,000
-"Well I’ve got a very strong feeling
about lenses and personally..."

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,899
-"...I’m sitting here talking to you and
you’re filming me from over there..."

37
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,220
-"...on a shoulder on probably a single.
Where, I’d rarely do that."

38
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,590
-"Cause I think, you know, the camera
wants to be..."

39
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,300
-"To me,
I would shoot singles inside here."

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,260
And if you do this, switch to
a wider lens and bring the camera closer

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,330
it feels like…

42
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,200
-"It’s different right? You know,
there’s a sense of presence..."

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
-"You’re right there with somebody,
as opposed to being…"

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,400
-"...I think psychologically,
it’s a totally different effect so…"

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,300
But what is the psychological effect?

46
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,200
If a long lens feels like you’re spying,
then how does this lens make you feel?

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,690
-"Look, look, something is very wrong!"

48
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
-"I don’t want Santana 'Abraxas.'"

49
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,800
-"I’ve just been in
a terrible auto accident!"

50
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,450
I would say it’s two feelings:

51
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,200
kind of uncomfortable…

52
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,660
and kind of funny.

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,950
And it fits.

54
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,250
Because the Coens
like to isolate individuals

55
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,450
trapping them in situations that
they really have no control over.

56
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,200
And because the lens is right here...

57
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,500
-"Now we had a deal here.
A deal’s a deal."

58
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,339
-"Is it Jerry? You ask those three poor
souls up in Brainerd if a deal’s a deal"

59
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,609
You’re trapped with them.

60
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,250
The other effect is visual.

61
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,790
The Coens shoot mostly
on a 27mm or 32mm lens

62
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,890
and they often push in to exaggerate
some part of an actor’s face.

63
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,589
-"Frank Raffo, my brother-in-law,
was the principal barber."

64
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,390
-"And man, could he talk."

65
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,429
Using wide lenses doesn’t just
exaggerate the face...

66
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,290
...it also exaggerates forward camera
movement, like dollying into a close-up.

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,890
-"Also a sense of action."

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,240
-"Like if I bring my hand closer or
further from the camera..."

69
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,340
-"...the wide-angle lens is going
to have much more effect."

70
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,940
-"And even if I’m shifting, like this."

71
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,950
-"Maybes don’t make it so."

72
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,300
-"It’s going to feel more alive,
more edgy."

73
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,330
-"What, are you kidding?
We got us a family here!"

74
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,200
But the third effect of
shooting singles this way...

75
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,399
...is environmental.

76
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,690
Shots like this have a nice balance...

77
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,390
...between the character
and everything around her.

78
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,350
-"I’d be very surprised
if our suspect was from Brainerd."

79
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,450
-"Yah."

80
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,250
And it helps us get a quick read
on very minor characters.

81
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,600
Think about how well you know this woman
just from her clothes and her workspace.

82
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,480
-"We can’t give out no information."

83
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,279
But what really distinguishes the Coens

84
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,279
...is the rhythm of their editing.

85
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,500
-"We depress the stock."

86
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,000
-"To the point where we can buy 50%"
-"51."

87
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,400
-"Not counting the mezzanine."

88
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,000
-"It could work!"
-"It should work!"

89
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,400
-"It would work!"
-"It’s working already!"

90
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,639
Many people think the rhythm
comes from their dialogue.

91
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,600
But the rhythm is actually nonverbal.

92
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,770
Sometimes, to feel the rhythm,
you have to see it done badly.

93
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,200
This is a film they wrote
but didn’t direct.

94
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,579
Watch the awkward pause
between two lines of dialogue.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,479
-"Not that I judge."

96
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,279
-"How terribly interesting."

97
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,300
-"But is there a tournament of some
description with rowdy goings-on?"

98
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:01,330
It just feels "off."

99
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,100
Now watch this moment,
directed by them.

100
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,200
-"Cigarette?"

101
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,520
-"Right."

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,720
And this rhythm is what underlies
so many of their scenes...

103
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,380
and it’s how they find nonverbal moments
that other directors don’t look for.

104
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,580
But what do all these choices add up to?

105
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,400
I think it creates a particular tone.

106
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,299
Because on one level, the Coens
want you to laugh at these people.

107
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,349
After all, they use the wide lens
to exaggerate the face

108
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,200
and they time the scene for humor.

109
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:50,770
But on another level, the Coens want you
to empathize with these characters.

110
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,520
They frame wide enough
so you can see the environment

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
...and they put the lens right
next to people at their lowest point.

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,100
-"I am dying."

113
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,239
-"Do something. Help me!"

114
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,800
There's an old saying:
Tragedy is a close-up.

115
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,900
Comedy is a long shot.

116
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:14,190
But for the Coens
those distinctions are jumbled.

117
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,269
They play both tragedy and comedy 
in intimate singles.

118
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,900
-"I miss Mike."

119
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,440
And that's the fascinating thing.

120
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,409
Because dialogue scenes aren't
just about recording the dialogue.

121
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:28,400
They're also about
the nonverbal behavior.

122
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,789
-"I don’t guess
this means much to you."

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,689
-"Hell yeah,
I could tell you some stories…"

124
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,489
-"And that’s the point!
That we all have stories..."

125
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,489
And by placing the camera here,

126
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:41,209
using a wide lens,
and following their particular rhythm

127
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:44,389
the Coens have found an interesting
approach to the most basic tool.

128
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,438
Shot

129
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,349
Reverse shot
