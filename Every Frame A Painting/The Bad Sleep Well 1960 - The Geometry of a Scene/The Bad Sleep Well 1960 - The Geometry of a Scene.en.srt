00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,360
Hi my name is Tony and this is a
quick Every Frame a Painting.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,480
Maybe you get this. Sometimes I’m
watching a scene and I just get so bored

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,500
Instead of being staged uniquely, the
scene is just this: standard coverage.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,110
Nobody moves, everybody gets a close-up,
and we’re stuck here

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,000
for five minutes cutting back and forth.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
<i>--It’s like a lot of films one
sees today. They’re what I call</i>

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,500
<i>photographs of people talking.</i>

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,120
<i>And bears no relation to
the art of the cinema.</i>

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,220
So here's one alternative from
Akira Kurosawa: instead of going

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,809
to standard coverage, stage the
scene in simple geometric shapes.

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,300
This scene comes from The Bad Sleep Well
and it focuses on two things

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,079
squares and triangles.
Here, Nishi hands the case to Shirai

13
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,670
and as he sits down again,
we get a very simple triangle:

14
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,000
two sets of eyes and the
bag with the stolen money.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,300
Notice that Kurosawa doesn’t
cut between reactions.

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,820
Instead our eyes naturally look at
one person’s face, then the other.

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,250
As Shirai grows afraid, the triangle
stretches out.

18
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,170
Even though we’re not thinking about it,
notice that the door is

19
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,869
always in frame in the background,
to prepare us for when...

20
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:21,300
As Moriyama approaches, the camera
reframes to trap Shirai inside a square.

21
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,820
And as the shorter man backs up...

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,110
we get this great composition:
three men, three sets of eyes.

23
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,020
Even though the verbal drama happens
between the two standing men,

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,729
its Nishi’s face closest to center frame
because we need to see his reaction

25
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,130
and make sure his cover isn’t blown.

26
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,030
Kurosawa breaks the triangle with a hand
and then a reveal.

27
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,560
Notice how just by moving his eyes,
we pay attention to Nishi.

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,219
And the triangle has subtly changed.
The two men on the left

29
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:55,979
have been brought closer together,

30
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,000
while the man on the right breaks
away to focus on the money.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,610
We get one last attempt at forgiveness
but it doesn’t work.

32
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,729
Shirai hesitates for half a second
and the scene ends

33
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,000
much as it began, with one person alone
planning his next move.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,930
Even though he never says a word,

35
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,549
Toshiro Mifune owns this scene with
just his posture and his eyes.

36
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:21,560
And Kurosawa, by staging it
in triangles and squares,

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,500
gives our eyes multiple points
to focus on, and a complete story

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,000
in two and a half minutes.

39
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,390
There’s even a geometric beauty about it

40
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:35,040
1 person, then 2, then 3, 2, 1.
Its a masterpiece of visual storytelling

41
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,549
If you liked this exercise, try
studying any other Kurosawa.

42
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:42,320
For each film, he found bold,
simple, visual ways to tell the story.

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,000
Seven Samurai has circles
and groups of seven.

44
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,230
Yojimbo has horizontal rows
and diagonal lines.

45
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,709
And the Hidden Fortress has
triangles and more triangles.

46
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:54,739
So the next time you have
multiple characters in a scene,

47
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:57,810
don't just shoot generic close-ups.
Be creative

48
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,000
and see what kind of
shapes you can make.
