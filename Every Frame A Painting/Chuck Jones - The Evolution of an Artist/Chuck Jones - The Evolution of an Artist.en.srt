00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi my name is Tony
and this is Every Frame a Painting.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,250
If you grew up like I did, you
probably watched a lot of Looney Tunes.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,240
And if you paid attention to the credits

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,600
then you recognize this name.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,118
-"My full name is
Charles Martin Jones."

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,300
-"This is not where I really belong."

7
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,699
-"I belong behind the camera."

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,070
Chuck Jones is one of the
all-time masters of visual comedy.

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,000
Between 1938 and 1962
he directed

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,189
more than 200 cartoons
for Warner Bros.

11
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:38,399
Ten films a year,
six minutes per film.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,230
What's astonishing is that they hold up
more than 50 years later.

13
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:48,308
And among them are some of the
greatest short films ever made.

14
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,049
But none of this happened overnight.
It was a long process.

15
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:53,799
So today, let’s take a look...

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,400
at how a good artist became a great one.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,200
-"All right.
Let’s get this picture started!"

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
-"No! No!"

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,240
The most famous aspect
of any Chuck Jones cartoon

20
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,399
(and the parts you probably remember)
are the jokes

21
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:18,769
written by
Michael Maltese and Tedd Pierce.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,310
Nearly every gag here follows
a classic two-part structure.

23
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,500
The first part…

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,799
leads you to make an assumption.
The second part...

25
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,799
proves it wrong.

26
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,500
That’s it. Assumption:

27
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,750
Reality.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,200
And in the early cartoons,
the jokes are fantastic

29
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:44,799
and they happen one after the other.

30
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,470
But here’s the truth:
the gags are only the surface level.

31
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:53,200
What really sets these films apart

32
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,500
is the amount of work
that was put into character.

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,300
And that process took a long time.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,800
-"All characters are
a process of learning."

35
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,600
-"It’s hard for people to
understand who watch actors...

36
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,109
-"...to realize that, actors come with
an ability. They’ve played other parts."

37
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,750
-"Hello."

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
-"When you bring in a drawing,
all you have is a drawing."

39
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,599
-"And you have to put in the character."

40
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,429
Consider the case of Daffy Duck.

41
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,000
When he first started out…

42
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,700
Daffy was more or less insane.

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,300
-"Gosh what a screwy duck."

44
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:28,239
But over the course of 15 years,
he changed

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,469
from being the one who laughs
to being the butt of the joke.

46
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,219
This Daffy is less crazy but
it’s easier to understand what he wants.

47
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:40,400
He wants money.

48
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:41,889
He wants to be a star.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,199
In short, he wants glory.

50
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,800
-"This looks like a job for...

51
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,870
-"...The Masked Avenger!"

52
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,000
In fact, all of Chuck Jones' characters
have very clearly defined wants.

53
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,799
This one wants a home.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,500
This one wants to daydream.

55
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:01,500
And this one just wants
somebody to love.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
-"Ah my little darling.
It is love at first sight, is it not?"

57
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,590
Notice that every desire here
is very simple.

58
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,300
And the simpler the desire,
the more vivid the character.

59
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,840
Once you know
what the character wants

60
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,300
you can figure out
the next question:

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,500
How does this
particular individual move?

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,759
-"Every action is dictated
by what goes on inside of you."

63
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,299
-"You have to be able to think
the way the character thinks."

64
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,879
-"If you can’t tell what’s happening
by the way the character moves..."

65
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,879
-"...you’re not animating."

66
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,000
-"I am a snake and
you have charmed me, no?"

67
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:36,299
-"It helps to have the dialogue..."

68
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,000
-"...but the dialogue is not
the thing that makes it work."

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,419
-"The story should tell itself
by the way it moves."

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,039
So let’s say you know
what the character wants

71
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,900
and you know how they move to get it.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,439
What about the jokes?

73
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,099
What happens to the assumption…

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,050
and the reality?

75
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,239
Well, now the assumption includes
the personality of the character.

76
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,300
For instance, we know that
Daffy will always pick a fight

77
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,609
because it’s part of
his desire for glory.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
-"Take over."

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,300
Likewise, we know
the Coyote’s device will fail

80
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,759
so Jones can play this gag offscreen

81
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,000
which ends up making it funnier.

82
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,639
But there is a danger to this approach.

83
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,219
If you just focus on great jokes
with the same well-defined characters

84
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,000
you can easily get trapped in a formula.

85
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,319
-"Sometimes I feel
very sorry for the Coyote."

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,399
-"Sometimes I wish he’d catch him."

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
-"If he caught him
there wouldn’t be any more Road Runner."

88
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,399
-"You wouldn’t like that, would you?"

89
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
So to avoid this problem,
Jones did something.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,629
This is one of the
defining aspects of his work.

91
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:51,949
It’s a word that he uses and
that other people use about him.

92
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,500
-"Beep Beep!"

93
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,110
-"It also stands out as an example
of the kind of discipline..."

94
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,580
-"...Chuck Jones liked
to set for himself."

95
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:02,500
-"This is the vital factor in
all comedy or all drama."

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,199
-"What are your disciplines?"

97
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,659
Discipline. The challenges and
restrictions you set for yourself.

98
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:10,000
Like designing a character
with no mouth.

99
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
Or no face.

100
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,299
Or using no dialogue except for this.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
-"Hello my baby, hello my honey,
hello my ragtime gal."

102
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,679
Because animation lets you do anything

103
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,840
you have to think about
what you won't do.

104
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,000
And in Jones’ case,
there were lots of rules

105
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,279
about the world, the characters
and their behavior.

106
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,000
For instance, Bugs Bunny
never picked a fight.

107
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,590
Somebody had to do this…

108
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:39,299
-"Kill the wabbit! Kill the wabbit!
Kill the wabbit!"

109
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,000
...and only then would he fight back.

110
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,069
-"Kill the wabbit?"

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,500
-"Bugs Bunny is not just
an insane rabbit."

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,360
-"Somebody’s always trying to get him.
And he’s retaliating."

113
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,399
-"He has to be provoked.
And we learned that."

114
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,000
-"It was very important
that he be provoked."

115
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,029
-"Because otherwise,
he’d be a bully."

116
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:01,599
-"Of course you realize
this means war."

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,139
A similar restriction happened to
how the characters expressed themselves.

118
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,199
Early on, they tended to go through
a quick barrage of facial expressions.

119
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,500
But over time, these grew less and less.

120
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:18,299
-"Particularly in the later films
Chuck became very fond..."

121
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,199
-"...of using the smallest
possible gestures..."

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,300
-"...facial gestures to get laughs."

123
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,449
-"Chuck’s facial expressions
were the best in the business..."

124
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:36,800
-"...Because he was a minimalist."

125
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:44,609
-"All humor grows from two things."

126
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,860
-"All humor, I believe, comes from
human behavior and logic."

127
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:50,399
-"If it’s not logical
it’s not gonna be funny...

128
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,799
-"...And if it doesn’t come from
human behavior..."

129
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,449
-"...how the hell
do you know it’s funny?"

130
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,000
Think of it this way:
this is human behavior.

131
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,000
-"Ha ha! Now!"

132
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:01,799
That was logic.

133
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,550
And the logic is something
you improve at over time.

134
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,200
But what about human behavior?

135
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,300
How do you improve at
understanding that?

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,689
The truth is, there’s only one way.

137
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,300
And it’s not by watching films.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,600
-"When you talk to Chuck,
he is always encouraging you..."

139
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,199
-...to go to the source:
to study real life, to study art..."

140
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:29,299
-"...and apply that to your animation.
It’s not just drawing funny faces."

141
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,619
Jones believed it wasn’t enough
to just watch movies.

142
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,500
You had to have interests
outside of film.

143
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,500
You had to study real life.

144
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,300
Most of all, he encouraged this:

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,199
-"Reading. Read Everything."

146
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,300
-"It doesn’t do you
much good to draw..."

147
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,799
-"...unless you have
something to draw..."

148
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:50,500
-"...and the only place
you can get anything to draw..."

149
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
-"...is from out of that head."

150
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:54,338
-"And the only way that
you can exercise the mind..."

151
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,100
-"...is by bringing new ideas to it..."

152
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,500
-"...So it’ll be surprised."

153
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,699
-"And say 'God I didn’t know that.'"

154
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,300
-"That’s the greatest thing
in the world..."

155
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,430
-"...that 'Gee I didn’t know that.'
And there you are, you know?"

156
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,650
There you are.
It’s not just about gags.

157
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,500
Not just about characters.

158
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:15,199
Not just about discipline.

159
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:18,299
It’s about studying the real world
and learning something new.

160
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,600
Then putting that back into the work.

161
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,399
In other words, inspiration.

162
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,310
And the great thing about
this kind of inspiration?

163
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,300
-"You can find it anyplace.
You can find it anyplace."
