00:00:05,286 --> 00:00:08,736
Hi, my name is Tony,
and this is Every Frame a Painting.

2
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:14,362
There's a quote that I love
from Alexander Mackendrick. He said :

3
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:18,094
<i>"What a film director really directs
is the audience attention ...</i>

4
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:24,043
<i>... Directing is a matter of emphasis ...</i>

5
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:27,073
<i>... You emphasize what is important ...</i>

6
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:32,198
<i>... by under-emphasizing
what is less so."</i>

7
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:39,963
These days, most directors create emphasis
by cutting from close-up ...

8
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:41,226
... to close up ...

9
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:42,358
... to close up.

10
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:45,935
But too much coverage is exhausting,
especially for the actors.

11
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:49,071
<i>- And say, oh, so now,
you're gonne be a mechanic,</i>

12
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:53,981
<i>so you should master close, close, closer,
over, over, over ...</i>

13
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:57,417
<i>I go hard lining, and say "Look,
I'm not gonna do that.",</i>

14
00:00:57,417 --> 00:01:01,277
<i>because you already got
everything you need to tell the audience</i>

15
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:03,770
<i>what they need to know
about what's happening here.</i>

16
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:07,597
So today, let's consider a different option.
Instead of standard coverage,

17
00:01:07,597 --> 00:01:09,784
let's put all the actors
in the same frame,

18
00:01:09,784 --> 00:01:11,256
and let them perform together.

19
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,344
In other words, let's talk about
'ensemble staging'.

20
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,723
Ensemble staging is all about
creating emphasis without using a cut

21
00:01:25,437 --> 00:01:29,458
The first thing to remember is that
we naturally look at whoever is speaking ...

22
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:33,342
and whoever is being spoken to.

23
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:36,541
This is often combined with
a second technique :

24
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:39,509
if someone is more important, 
put them closer to the light,

25
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,756
or closer to the lens.

26
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:46,614
If you want someone to be less noticeable,
move them further away,

27
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,594
maybe out of focus.

28
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:57,813
Of course, attention is relative.
Sometimes, you can get the audience

29
00:01:57,813 --> 00:02:00,238
to look at something,
even when it's out of focus.

30
00:02:03,802 --> 00:02:05,278
By having it move.

31
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,469
We're especially aware
when somebody moves their hands ...

32
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:13,185
or moves their eyes.

33
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:18,756
You can also guide the audience by putting
something close to the center of the frame.

34
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:24,459
In fact, this is one of the film's
running jokes.

35
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:26,866
Characters in the middle of the shot ...

36
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:30,522
... who keep attacking the suspects.

37
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:36,738
Which brings us to #5 :
the body position of the actors.

38
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:40,060
How are the characters turned
in relation to the lens ?

39
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:43,072
Do we see their whole face ...
or 3/4 ?

40
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:48,211
Is it a profile ... or another angle
where we don't see the face at all ?

41
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:52,864
When you have multiple actors in a shot,
it's important to have some variation.

42
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,821
The audience doesn't need to look at
a character right now : turn him around.

43
00:02:57,328 --> 00:02:59,808
Notice how by doing this,
you're creating contrast.

44
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:03,970
The 3 cops on the right face each other,
while detective Seo looks elsewhere.

45
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,667
In fact, for the first half-hour, he's
constantly placed away from the main group,

46
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,583
looking at documents
that everyone else is ignoring.

47
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:14,253
This bring us to #7 :

48
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:18,243
Subtly moving the camera.

49
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:22,753
Here watch out the shot
narrow our focus from 4 characters ...

50
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:29,514
... down to 2.
While here, our attention moves

51
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:34,959
from one side of the argument, to the other,
fore-settling on the eventual winner.

52
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:41,687
And last of all, don't forget that
human beings are social creatures :

53
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:44,318
We look where other people are looking.

54
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:54,030
So with all that, let's consider why Bong Joon-ho
would stage something as an ensemble.

55
00:03:54,563 --> 00:03:56,817
This is my favourite shot
in the entire film.

56
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:04,532
At first we think it's one story,
an argument between two cops.

57
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,151
And Bong seems to do very little.
He just lets our attention move

58
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:11,428
from detective Park ...
to detective Seo.

59
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:18,499
But in the center of frame,
something catches our eye,

60
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:21,563
and we realize another character,
detective Cho, is making out

61
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:23,124
with the hostess in the back.

62
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:26,930
So now we have 2 stories :
foreground & background.

63
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:30,466
And Bong plays them against each other,
to contrast the serious ...

64
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:38,965
... with the silly. As the scene builds,
he slowly pushes the camera in,

65
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:42,447
which hides the 2 women,
and focus our attention on the main pair.

66
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:48,800
And he lets the actors use their hands
to tell the story,

67
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:51,589
especially when the argument
reaches his breaking point.

68
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,554
But suddenly, the chief enters the scene.

69
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:05,469
This is the moment when
the ensemble staging pays off.

70
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:09,582
We have an unexpected third story, and
it interrupts both of the others.

71
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:18,976
With a joke.

72
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:22,979
From now on, the rest of the scene
is the third story,

73
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,060
as the chief outlines his plan
to catch the serial killer.

74
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:34,410
But why do this in one shot ?
I think it underscores the theme.

75
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:41,094
The first story is a petty argument.
The second story is just lust.

76
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:45,166
None of these cops is doing work,
they're all being selfish.

77
00:05:45,406 --> 00:05:49,548
It's not until the third story that
they think about the victims and the case.

78
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,367
The chief literally provides
the moral center of the frame.

79
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:58,827
And if Bong had shot this scene
with coverage,

80
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:01,692
we wouldn't see the connection
between the first story ...

81
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:06,439
... and the second.
And from both stories ...

82
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:10,674
... to the third.

83
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,019
This is the kind of directing that is
unbelievably rare today,

84
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:16,995
and it shows the value of
playing a scene as an ensemble,

85
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:19,372
rather than cutting
from one face to another.

86
00:06:19,642 --> 00:06:24,239
<i>- Because sometimes, I just want to stay
in that particular place, with the actors,</i>

87
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:29,008
<i>and let the actors settle it,
and not let you help me tell the story</i>

88
00:06:29,008 --> 00:06:32,191
<i>by getting closer to my face.
Just let me do it.</i>
