1
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:09,091
Hi. My name is Tony
and this is Every Frame a Painting.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,087
And I know exactly what you're thinking:
Why am I talking about this guy?

3
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:14,987
<i>— Oh my god, you're Michael Bay!</i>

4
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,509
<i>— Oh my god, I am Michael Bay.</i>
Because I don't like his films

5
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:20,965
and yet I think it's crucial
to study them.

6
00:00:20,993 --> 00:00:22,015
Why?

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:26,475
<i>— ...and Paul, I think you have started
to watch WrestleMania on television...</i>

8
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:27,350
<i>— Well, I...</i>

9
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:31,791
<i>— Because you must not avert your eyes:
this is what is coming at us.</i>

10
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:35,413
<i>this is what what television,
what a collective</i>

11
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:40,438
<i>anonymous body of majority wants
to see on television.</i>

12
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,507
Like WrestleMania, like Anna Nicole Smith,

13
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:46,179
like Jackass, Michael Bay has created
<i>something.</i>

14
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,045
<i>— Spectacle!</i>

15
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:51,710
<i>It's what people want. The Romans new it,
Louis Quatorze knew it, Wolfowitz knows it.</i>

16
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:52,777
<i>— One, two, three...</i>

17
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,875
<i>Boom! Bayhem!!</i>

18
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:58,890
We may find it crass and vulgar,
but if we're going to make better movies,

19
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:01,075
we have to understand
the images that are coming at us.

20
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:02,232
<i>— Hey, hey!!</i>

21
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:07,600
So let's talk about <i>Bayhem.</i>
Is it a unique use of film form?

22
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:14,259
If you want to understand Michael Bay, one of
the best ways is to watch his copycats.

23
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:16,858
Consider this shot from
'Battleship', which tries

24
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:19,393
to do that circular camera
move he's famous for.

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,862
Doesn't work here.
Why?

26
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:25,402
It's actually really simple. First,
there's no background, except for blue sky.

27
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:28,585
Without a background, we don't get parallax,
so the shot doesn't feel like it's moving.

28
00:01:28,593 --> 00:01:30,505
See the difference?

29
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:35,177
On top of that, the lens is wrong. Bay frequently
shoots these shots with a telephoto lens,

30
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:38,481
which compresses the space.
This makes the background whizz by.

31
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:41,069
Third, the actor's just staring
and turning his head,

32
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:43,772
but the key to the Bay version
is that the actors move vertically.

33
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:44,980
Like here.

34
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:46,132
And here.

35
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:50,650
And last, the low angle is there to give us the
scale and slow motion is there to sell it.

36
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:54,481
So what we have here in the Bay's shot
is multiple types of movement, integrated:

37
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,420
movement of the camera,
movement of the background,

38
00:01:57,445 --> 00:01:59,873
movement of the actors,
expansion of time.

39
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:03,236
Then they stand still and look
off-screen, creating stillness.

40
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:08,161
Even though you're looking at a stationary
point in the frame, this shot feels huge.

41
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:10,455
<i>— Shit just got real.</i>

42
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,003
Breakdown any Michael Bay's shot
and that is basically what you will see:

43
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:18,906
layers of depth, parallax, movement,
character and environment

44
00:02:18,926 --> 00:02:20,687
to give this sense of epicness.

45
00:02:20,846 --> 00:02:23,322
None of these techniques
is particularly unique.

46
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:27,326
In fact, most cinematographers
will naturally create depth in their images

47
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:29,317
and parallax, whenever the camera moves.

48
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:31,425
And the Hero Shot is everywhere.

49
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:37,347
What makes Bay unique is how many layers
and how complex the movement is.

50
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:39,669
That doesn't make his shots
better, it just makes

51
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:41,686
them more complicated
than the competition.

52
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:44,060
That's why his frames seem to have
a lot of stuff going on.

53
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:48,091
Lots of dust, dirt, smoke
or explosions between the layers.

54
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,360
Also, lamp-posts.

55
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:53,638
Lots of lamp-posts.

56
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,390
If you go back to the first Bad Boys, you
can watch this from the opening credits.

57
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:00,889
Here, the car moves one way,
the plane another,

58
00:03:00,896 --> 00:03:04,078
the lamp-posts are in frame for scale
and the camera is on a telephoto lens.

59
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,461
Later in the film, you can see
the same compositional techinique.

60
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:10,069
And when the explosions happen...

61
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:13,242
Once you see this, it's much easier
to deconstruct his imagery

62
00:03:13,272 --> 00:03:14,870
and to see its limits.

63
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:18,134
For instance, Bay doesn't distinguish
between when to do a shot

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,551
and when <i>not</i> to do it. He'll
use the same camera movement,

65
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:22,790
whether the charachter's
saying something important...

66
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:25,226
<i>— You have any money here in the States?</i>

67
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:27,003
... or total gibberish...

68
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:29,765
<i>— What did I say?!
Did you hear what I said?</i>

69
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:32,957
<i>I heard what I said
'cause I was standing there when I said it.</i>

70
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,322
Every shot is designed for maximum visual
impact, regardless of whether it fits.

71
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:44,110
But the Bay style also leads
to some fascinating visual ideas.

72
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:46,230
How can you make something feel big?

73
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:49,411
Well, you put lots of things
of varying size in the same shot

74
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:51,537
and then you move the camera to emphasize.

75
00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:54,656
This is something "Jurassic Park" also
did very well.

76
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:58,516
<i>— Ah!
— It's... It's a dinosaur.</i>

77
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,961
Just as important is off-screen space.

78
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:04,537
Notice here, this actor isn't looking
at the planes we see in the background.

79
00:04:04,552 --> 00:04:07,132
That means there's even
more planes we can't see.

80
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:10,799
So while the shot feels huge,
it implies even more scale.

81
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:13,432
How does a filmmaker come up
with images like this?

82
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:16,464
In the case of Michael Bay, let's look
at one of his favorite films.

83
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,308
<i>"When you're a Jet,
you're a Jet all the way</i>

84
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:22,893
<i>From your first cigarette
to your last dying day"</i>

85
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:25,942
There's a great New York Times interview
where he watches "West Side Story"

86
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,798
and talks about how
<i>this</i> is a great shot

87
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:30,701
and <i>this</i> is a great cut.

88
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,799
He can't articulate why they're great,
other than "they're dynamic".

89
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,617
But I think that's it:
when you put shots from West Side Story

90
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,832
back to back with his work,
you can feel the similarities.

91
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:43,112
I think Bay's goal is to create
what he thinks are good shots

92
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:45,255
and connect them with
what he thinks are good cuts.

93
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:48,629
If Howard Hawks defined a good movie
as three good scenes and no bad ones,

94
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,556
Michael Bay seems to
think a good film

95
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:53,862
is three thousand dynamic shots
and no static ones.

96
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:01,074
Apart from West Side Story, Bay's biggest
influence is actually other blockbusters.

97
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:04,584
He frequently borrows the same basic
vocabularies and other sequence.

98
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:06,815
So something like this...

99
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:10,338
... becomes this.

100
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,495
You'll notice the tight shots
of the character become tighter.

101
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:17,037
And the wide shots become wider.

102
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,068
Everything gets more layers of motion,
but the basic vocabulary's the same.

103
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:26,987
<i>- I got him!
- Great, kid! Don't get cocky.</i>

104
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:29,346
And it's not just other people
he borrows from.

105
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,829
Bay cannibalizes himself just as much.

106
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,870
So this...

107
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,657
... becomes this.

108
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:43,023
You'll notice every motion
in the original shot.

109
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:45,256
For instance, the camera
turning counter-clockwise,

110
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:46,903
while the bomb turns clockwise —

111
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,153
it's just cranked up in this version.

112
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:51,966
<i>— Autobots, I'm in pursuit.</i>

113
00:05:51,975 --> 00:05:53,797
So what is Bayhem?

114
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:56,130
It's the use of movement, composition
and fast editing

115
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:58,257
to create a sense of epic scale.

116
00:05:58,278 --> 00:06:02,557
Each individual shot feels huge, but also
implies bigger things outside the frame.

117
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:07,084
It stacks multiple layers of movement shot
either on a very long lens or a very wide one.

118
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:09,728
It shows you a lot for just a moment
and then takes it away.

119
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:13,380
You feel the overall motion,
but no grasp of anything concrete.

120
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:16,920
And yet, it requires a lot of people
and integration to do this.

121
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,880
But it's basically a variation on the
existing vocabulary of the action scene.

122
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:25,825
Individual shots are a little dirtier, a little
shakier, more complex, few more layers.

123
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,869
Then you cut it together faster
than the brain can register,

124
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,929
but not faster than the eye can move.

125
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:34,480
It's not revolutionary,
just the past with a bit of stank on it.

126
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:39,807
If you want to see a more
etxreme version of similiar ideas,

127
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:41,718
you can look at late-era Tony Scott.

128
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:45,482
And if you wanna see a less cluttered
version, you can look at animation.

129
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:47,450
Someone like Glen Keane.

130
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:50,995
This is way more legible than what Bay does,
but the basic idea is the same:

131
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:54,370
character, environment,
many layers, one epic sweep.

132
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:56,401
The world feels huge.

133
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:02,869
One of my favorite adaptations of the
Michael Bay style is actually shrinking it down.

134
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:07,051
Ironically, Bayhem - which seems to have
developed from a kid blowing up his train set -

135
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,228
is actually kind of charming when it's tiny.

136
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:13,023
Instead of blowing up the world,
how about a small English town?

137
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:14,648
<i>— Swan!</i>

138
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,773
But in the end, I think the popularity of
this style is hugely important.

139
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,273
Whether we like it or not,
the interesting thing here

140
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:29,357
is that we are really
visually sophisticated

141
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,449
and totally visually illiterate.

142
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:34,829
We can process visual information
at a speed that wasn't common before,

143
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:37,584
but thinking through what an image means...

144
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:39,061
<i>— This is not necessary!</i>

145
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,314
... not so much.

146
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:41,942
And as Wernor Herzog put it:

147
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:45,577
<i>— You do not avert your eyes.
That's what's coming at us.</i>

148
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,855
This might sound a little weird, but
the person who loses the most here

149
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:52,450
is actually Michael Bay.
He is a slave to his own eye.

150
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:55,204
He has a need to make
every image dynamic, even

151
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,998
when it runs contrary to
the theme of his movie.

152
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:03,958
<i>— Some people just don't know a good thing
when it's staring them in the face.</i>

153
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:08,115
<i>— It really is the simple things in life...</i>

154
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:10,216
Yeah, the little things,
like a big house,

155
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:12,526
a dock, a view of the water
and a speed boat.

156
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:16,853
What happens when two great storytellers
tackle this exact same theme?

157
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:20,514
<i>— Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doing pretty good.</i>

158
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:25,576
<i>— I love you, Margie.</i>

159
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,956
<i>— I love you, Norm.</i>

160
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:33,196
<i>— Two more months.</i>

161
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:39,467
<i>— Two more months...</i>
