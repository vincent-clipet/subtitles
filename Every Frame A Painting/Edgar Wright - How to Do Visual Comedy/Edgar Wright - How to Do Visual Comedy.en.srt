1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
<i>-- One, two, three four !</i>

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,039
Hi my name is Tony and this is
Every Frame a Painting.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,638
So today I’m going to talk about
a director whose work I love.

4
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,189
but before that let me be upfront.
I think comedy movies today,

5
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,769
especially American ones,
have totally lost their way.

6
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:19,129
I don't hate the jokes
or the actors or the dialogue

7
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:21,320
or the stories though
there's plenty of issues there.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,600
My real qualm is that the filmmaking,

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,880
the use of picture and sound
to deliver jokes, is just...

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,210
<i>--What?
--This is booooring.</i>

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,210
<i>--Delete.</i>

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,969
Look, everyone’s taste is different.

13
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:37,609
What you find funny is what you funny.
So I’m not saying these movies suck

14
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:41,219
or you suck if you like them.
What I am saying is that

15
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,159
these movies aren’t movies.
They’re lightly edited improv.

16
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,940
Everyone stands still and
talks at each other in close-up.

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,089
Almost none of these jokes come visually
They’re overwhelming sound.

18
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:53,480
And not even the full range of sound,
just dialogue. And this is really sad

19
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,168
because that’s just a fraction
of what’s possible in cinema.

20
00:00:56,168 --> 00:00:58,258
Apart from animation
and some commercials,

21
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:01,389
visual comedy is actually
moving backwards. And that's why

22
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:05,130
if you love this kind of stuff,
I cannot recommend Edgar Wright enough.

23
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,390
<i>--You're a doctor, deal with it.
--Yeah, motherfucker.</i>

24
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,680
He's one of the only people
working in the genre
using the full range of what is possible.

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,409
And because of that, he can find
humor in places that others don’t look.

26
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,050
Here’s an example.
Say you need to move your character

27
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,049
from one city to another to get the
story going. How do you shoot it?

28
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,100
And can you get a joke out of it?
...Well, no.

29
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:28,629
Not if you send out a 2nd unit to do it,
every shot pans from left to right,

30
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:32,089
you include obvious landmarks and signs,
you mix in generic helicopter footage

31
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:35,299
and you put upbeat music under it
so the audience doesn’t get bored.

32
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:42,700
This is just lazy filmmaking and boring.
We’ve seen it a million times.

33
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,210
What would happen if you were truly
inventive with this type of scene?

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,890
There we go! And this isn’t
just a series of quick cuts.

35
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,219
There’s a lot of good
visual storytelling here.

36
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:07,719
These 2 taxi shots tell you exactly
where we came from and where we’re going.

37
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,408
These 2 shots emphasize
the move away from civilization.

38
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:12,930
Our main character always faces
forward or to the right

39
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,500
so screen direction is respected.
Turning the music down

40
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,010
and the sound FX up is funny
because each cut is jarring.

41
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,310
And there’s even some nice performances
from Simon Pegg and Ryan Gosling.

42
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,120
Okay that was 1 example without context.
You’re right. Totally unfair.

43
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,619
Well what if you had a movie where
a horrible apocalyptic event happens,

44
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,689
and you want to foreshadow it earlier,
maybe by having the characters

45
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:37,570
not notice something important on TV.
How would you show it?

46
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:40,699
Would you just throw it in the edit
for 2 seconds and 2 frames

47
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,719
and no shot shows the relationship
between the characters and the TV?

48
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,750
<i>--he's having a housewarming party,
he just finished building his house.</i>

49
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,350
Or would you do this?

50
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,049
<i>--Although no one official is prepared
to comment, religious groups are</i>

51
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:54,979
<i>calling it judgment day. There's ...</i>
<i>-- panic on the streets of London</i>

52
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,330
<i>--as an increasing number of reports of
--serious attacks on</i>

53
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,469
<i>--people who are literally being
--eaten alive</i>

54
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:06,279
Okay still unfair. What if you had movie
where one character has stopped drinking

55
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:09,639
but the others are disappointed in him
and you want to get a joke out of it.

56
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,629
How would you do it?

57
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:13,619
Would they just stand around
and talk about his drinking?

58
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,710
<i>--No I appreciate it but I told my wife
I wouldn't drink tonight</i>

59
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,769
<i>--Besides I got a big day tomorrow.
You guys have a great time.</i>

60
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:22,489
<i>--Big day? Doing what?</i>

61
00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:24,214
Or would you do this ?

62
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:25,299
<i>--What?!</i>

63
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:34,924
<i>-- I don't believe this.</i>

64
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,559
This is what separates a mediocre
director from a great one. The ability

65
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:42,098
to take the most simple mundane scenes
and find new ways to do them.

66
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:45,919
Great directors understand that you
can get a laugh just through staging.

67
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,348
Here’s an example from David Bordwell:
things popping up into frame are funny.

68
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:55,769
<i>--Slow ahead, I can go slow ahead.
Come on down and chum some of this shit!</i>

69
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,790
And it’s not just things entering frame.
Consider the opposite.

70
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,119
<i>--I said tell Ms. Laura "Goodbye"</i>

71
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:09,220
<i>--Bye, Ms. Laura</i>

72
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,910
You can get a laugh from a zoom.

73
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:18,250
<i>--You wanna pop the trunk and roll
the windows down, please?</i>

74
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,030
You can get a laugh from a crane up.
<i>--Shirley, I'm so sorry.</i>

75
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,839
<i>--I'm going home, Britta.
--I know, Shirley, I know.</i>

76
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,260
<i>--No I'm going home, can you help me up?
--Oh</i>

77
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,510
You can get a laugh from a pan.

78
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,320
As Martin Scorsese put it :

79
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,849
cinema is a matter of what’s in
the frame and what’s not in the frame.

80
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:54,550
So think about the frame. And this isn’t
a matter of smart or stupid comedy.

81
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,000
Really if it works, it works.

82
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:09,189
So here are 8 things Edgar Wright
does with picture and sound

83
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:12,410
that I want to see other
comedy filmmakers try out.

84
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,960
#1 : Things entering the frame
in funny ways

85
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,110
#2 : People leaving the frame
in funny ways

86
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:47,489
#3 : There and back again

87
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:10,819
#4 : Matching scene transitions

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,070
#5 : The perfectly-timed sound effect

89
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,469
#6 : Action synchronized to the music

90
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,380
#7 : Super-dramatic lighting cues

91
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,159
And #8 ...

92
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,440
And you know what, let's thrown in
#9 :

93
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,300
So if you’re a filmmaker, work on this.
The frame is a playground. So play.

94
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,439
And the next time you go to
a theater and pay $15 to see a comedy,

95
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:48,019
don’t be satisfied with shit
that is less inventive than Vine.
