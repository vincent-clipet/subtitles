00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,500
Hi my name is Tony and
this is Every Frame a Painting.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,389
So here’s a fundamental question:

3
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:13,879
When you’re judging a shot,
what’s the first thing you look for?

4
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:16,000
Is it balance?

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,500
Leading lines?

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,200
Golden ratio?

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Color? Light? Shapes?

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,660
I think these are all essential,
and they’re all part of good images.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,300
But there’s one thing
I always notice first

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,900
Movement

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,440
--For me, Kurosawa is the
Beethoven of movie directors

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,000
--It's that recognizable full sound
that Beethoven had

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,940
--that is so unmistakable

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,500
A Kurosawa film moves like no one else’s

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,500
Each one is a masterclass
in different types of motion

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,500
and also ways to combine them.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,940
Over a career spanning half a century
he made 30 films

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,510
and in all of them, the movement
is surprising and cinematic.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Wow. If you’d like to see the names
of the films, press the CC button below.

20
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,200
So what types of movement did he like?

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,500
First, there’s the movement of nature.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,300
In every one of his films,
the background of the shot

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,500
features some kind of weather.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Wind

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Water

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
Fire

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Smoke

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Snow

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,500
One advantage of this approach is that
shots have a lot of visual interest.

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,509
Even when people are still, there’s rain
in the background to draw your eye.

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,270
--Rain is a real emotional trigger
that works in any film.

32
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,509
--You know, anything that’s excessive
because it gives you

33
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:52,770
--another layer that the
audience can relate to sensually.

34
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,279
Second, there’s the movement of groups.

35
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:59,090
Kurosawa films usually feature large
groups of people who band together

36
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,399
or split apart.

37
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:05,520
Crowds like this are really cinematic.
When you put this many people in a shot,

38
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,340
any emotion feels big.

39
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,840
If you want a good reaction shot,
try using four people

40
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,380
Or twenty-five

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,000
And if you want something really big...

42
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,229
Which brings us to #3:
the movement of individuals.

43
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,310
One of my favorite things
about Kurosawa is that

44
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,610
that his blocking is
unrealistic and exaggerated.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,500
If someone is nervous,
they pace left and right.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,300
If they’re outraged, 
they stand straight up.

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,900
And if they’re ashamed…

48
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,750
He would often tell his actors to pick
one gesture for their character

49
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,450
and repeat it throughout the film.

50
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,500
That way, the audience can quickly see
who’s who and how they’re feeling.

51
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,400
Number four: movement of the camera.

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,680
One of the hallmarks of Kurosawa’s style
are his fluid camera moves

53
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,680
that go from close-up to full shot to
OTS in a single unbroken take.

54
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:21,459
I did another essay about these shots,
called the Spielberg Oner,

55
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,600
but what’s important here is that
every camera move has a clear beginning

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
middle

57
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
and end.

58
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,300
Just by itself,
this camera move tells a story.

59
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,480
And last, there’s movement of the cut.

60
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,099
Kurosawa is one of the few directors
who worked as his own editor.

61
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:44,920
One of the reasons his movies just flow
is that he tends to cut on movement.

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,300
Often, you’re paying so much attention
to someone who's moving

63
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,299
that you don’t see the edit.

64
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,300
When he finishes the scene,
he switches the rhythm

65
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,299
usually by ending on something static.

66
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,180
and then cutting straight into movement.

67
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,400
By switching up the rhythm,
he keeps you on your toes,

68
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,300
because you can’t guess the next cut.

69
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:14,359
So with all that, let’s break down
one scene and study the motion.

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,600
This scene is from Seven Samurai.
I won't tell you what it’s about.

71
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,940
See how long it takes you
to figure it out. Ready?

72
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,000
The first shot shows the whole village,
then just the important characters

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,300
then just the samurai.

74
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,500
Right about here...

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,150
most people get what’s happening.

76
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,400
As Kikuchiyo sits down his mood ripples
outwards to affect the whole village.

77
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,110
Notice how much the wind adds to the
scene. Even when people are still

78
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,300
there’s that little bit of wind
to spice up the frame.

79
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,650
So that’s pretty straightforward.

80
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,370
Now let’s jump 60 years into the future.
This is The Avengers.

81
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,770
Here, we start with a camera move into
an establishing shot. But this time...

82
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,770
--These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

83
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,630
We get dialogue right away.

84
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,090
Throughout this scene, the only things
that move are the camera and Nick Fury.

85
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,500
Even though we have weather outside and
actors in the background

86
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,800
none of them are used.

87
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,800
Notice that the camera movement doesn’t
have a beginning or an end.

88
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,280
And there’s no variation. Each shot
goes in the exact same direction

89
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,500
--Maybe I had that coming.

90
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,250
But in Seven Samurai...

91
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,500
The camera moves have a distinct
beginning middle and end.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And each shot changes 
direction from the previous one.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,500
As he climbs up, Kurosawa uses
the movement of the flag

94
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,129
to cut smoothly into this angle:

95
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:36,800
all seven samurai and
their banner, together.

96
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,599
This scene has every type of movement

97
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,200
carefully pieced together
and spaced throughout.

98
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:48,300
The weather.

99
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,300
The group.

100
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,300
The individual.

101
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,300
The camera.

102
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,300
The cut.

103
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,440
But this scene tells its story
mostly through dialogue

104
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,440
--called the Avengers Initiative.

105
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,520
Sure, the camera moves.
But it’s pointless movement.

106
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,300
For all the money that was put into it,
this scene feels flat

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,200
--It's an old-fashioned notion.

108
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,229
But how could you improve this scene?
Well...

109
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:15,940
if you know what the scene’s about,
try to express it through movement.

110
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,300
Start with the character.
How are they feeling?

111
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,680
Is there any way the actor
can convey that by moving?

112
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,289
Okay, maybe that's too much.
Let’s be more subtle.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Take the feeling that’s
inside the character

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,539
and bring it out
through the background.

115
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,539
If a character is angry and menacing,
you can do this

116
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,650
Or if she's simmering
with resentment.

117
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,650
Another option is to contrast
one person against the group.

118
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,539
So if somebody suffers a very
public humiliation, this works.

119
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,190
Or if they’re looking for
a needle in a haystack

120
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,509
You can use camera movement
to convey excitement

121
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,689
You can cut on movement
to show surprise

122
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,200
And you can combine every type of motion
into one amazing image

123
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:13,000
By the way, you don’t need to put every
type of movement in every shot.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That’s just tiring.

125
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,419
But there’s a nice middle ground with
lots of variation and subtlety

126
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:22,259
and you won’t know what
works best until you try it.

127
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,259
If you combine the right motion
and the right emotion

128
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,259
you get something cinematic.

129
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,000
--But just for me, I look at his movies
two or three times a year

130
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,080
--just to feel, oh wow, that’s why
I wanted to be a filmmaker

131
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,800
--and look what I’m doing now.

132
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,300
--Special effects, and then
another movie about special effects

133
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,500
--and then a third movie
about special effects.

134
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:53,500
Now pick any of his films.
Go to any scene.

135
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,460
And watch how everything moves together

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,500
--You know, it’s the visual stimulation
that hits the audience.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,020
That’s the reason for film.

138
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,000
Otherwise, we should just
turn the light out and call it radio.
