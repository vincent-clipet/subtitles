00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:10,699
Hi my name is Tony and
this is Every Frame a Painting.

2
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:13,939
Today I’m going to talk about one of
the greats of the last twenty years

3
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:16,739
the Japanese filmmaker Satoshi Kon.

4
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:19,389
Even if you don’t know his work you have
certainly seen some of his images.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,300
He is an acknowledged influence on both
Darren Aronofsky and Christopher Nolan

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,140
And he has a fan base that includes just
about everyone who loves animation.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,880
In one decade, he made
four feature films and one TV series

8
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:32,619
all of them amazingly consistent,
all of them about

9
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,669
how modern people cope
with living multiple lives.

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,710
Private, public. Offscreen, onscreen.
Waking, dreaming.

11
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,000
If you’ve seen his work you’ll recognize
this blurring of reality and fantasy.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,890
Today, I’m only going to focus on
one thing: his excellent editing.

13
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,799
So as an editor, I’m always looking
for new ways to cut

14
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,939
especially from outside
the realm of live-action.

15
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:59,539
Kon was one of the most fascinating.
His most noticeable habit

16
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:02,409
was matching scene transitions.

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,379
I've mentioned before that Edgar Wright
does this for visual comedy

18
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:16,099
<i>--Scott!
--What?

19
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:18,099
It's part of a tradition that includes
The Simpsons

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,010
and Buster Keaton.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,010
Kon was different. His inspiration
was the movie version of

22
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,370
Slaughterhouse-Five
directed by George Roy Hill.

23
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,359
<i>--I can always tell, you know,
when you've been time-tripping

24
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,519
This is more of a sci-fi tradition
that includes Philip K Dick

25
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,519
and Terry Gilliam

26
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,200
But even among peers,
Kon pushed this idea pretty far.

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,250
Slaughterhouse-Five has basically
three types of scene transitions:

28
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,000
a general match cut

29
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,740
an exact graphic match

30
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,158
and intercutting two different time
periods, which mirror each other.

31
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,340
Kon did all of these things,
but he would also

32
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,500
rewind the film,
cross the line into a new scene,

33
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,599
zoom out from a TV,
use black frames to jump cut,

34
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,599
use objects to wipe frame, and
I don't even know what to call this.

35
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:24,158
To show you how dense this gets,
the opening four minutes of Paprika

36
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:28,000
has five dream sequences and every
single one is connected by a match cut.

37
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,180
Number six is not connected
by a match cut,

38
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,209
but there is a
graphic match within the scene.

39
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,359
Just for comparison, the opening
fifteen minutes of Inception

40
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:44,000
has four interconnected dreams.
Number of match cuts: one.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,359
<i>--What is the most resilient parasite?

42
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:50,959
Cuts like this aren’t uncommon,
but they’re definitely not something

43
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,000
most filmmakers build a style out of.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,818
Usually you see them as one-off effects.
Two of the most famous examples:

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,620
Oh and this one because it's amazing

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,500
Kon’s work was about the interaction
between dreams, memories,

47
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,658
nightmares, movies, and life.

48
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:12,789
The matching images were how
he linked the different worlds.

49
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:15,000
Sometimes he would stack transitions
back to back,

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,500
so you’d be getting used to one scene
before you got thrown into the next.

51
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,709
All of this made him really
surprising to watch.

52
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,670
You could blink and miss that
you’re in a different scene.

53
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,878
Even when he wasn't dealing with dreams,
Kon was an unusual editor.

54
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:43,359
He loved ellipses and would often
just jump past part of the scene.

55
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,840
So you’d see a character look at a key.

56
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,060
You expect to see her take it,
but that doesn’t happen.

57
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,000
The scene just moves on.
Later on, in a different scene:

58
00:03:57,769 --> 00:03:59,900
Or you’d see a man jumping
out of a window and fade out.

59
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,439
We’d then cut to a scene we didn’t
understand, reveal that this is a dream,

60
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,000
back out, and then show the
conclusion of the previous scene.

61
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,658
Even things like murder, he would
do the build-up and cut away.

62
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:15,060
But he would show us the gory result.

63
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,418
I particularly love the way
he handled character death.

64
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,060
Here, an old man dies and
the windmills of his hut stop.

65
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,009
Then it turns out he’s alive,
so they start up again.

66
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:30,848
When we finish the scene,
the windmill shot doesn’t repeat,

67
00:04:30,848 --> 00:04:33,969
but you’ll notice they aren’t moving,
implying he is dead.

68
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,970
Kon also had a habit of starting scenes
in close-up and you’d figure out

69
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,270
where you were as the scene went on.

70
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:41,269
Every once in a while,
he’d use an establishing shot.

71
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:44,549
And then reveal that it was actually a
point-of-view. So without you noticing,

72
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,870
he brought you
 into the character’s world.

73
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,720
He was constantly showing one image and
then revealing that it wasn’t

74
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,560
what you thought it was.

75
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,000
Your experience of space and time
became subjective.

76
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,519
He could also edit in ways that a
lot of live-action filmmakers could not.

77
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,379
During an interview, Kon said that
he didn’t want to direct live action

78
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,519
because his editing was too fast.

79
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,000
For example:

80
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:13,000
This shot of the bag is only 6 frames.
For a comparable moment in live action

81
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,000
that was 10 frames.
Or how about this insert of a note?

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,500
10 frames. But in live-action...

83
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,788
49 frames. Kon felt that as an animator,
he could draw less information

84
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:31,269
in the shot, so your
eye could read it faster.

85
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:34,930
You can actually see someone like Wes
Anderson doing this in live-action

86
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,288
removing visual information
so his inserts “read" faster.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,110
It’s worth noting: you can actually cut
much faster than this, but the images

88
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,500
pretty much become subliminal.
Some of these shots are 1 frame.

89
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:51,668
None of this was for cheap effect.
Kon felt that we each experience

90
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:55,870
space, time, reality and fantasy
at the same time as individuals

91
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,478
and also collectively as a society.
His style was an attempt to depict this

92
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:03,658
in images and sound. In the course of
ten years, he pushed animation in ways

93
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,490
that aren’t really
possible in live action.

94
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,490
Not just elastic images, but elastic
editing -- a unique way of moving from

95
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,098
image to image, scene to scene. And he
was helped in this crusade by

96
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:16,399
the studio Madhouse, who did
some of their finest work on his films.

97
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,250
If you want to see a perfect summation
of his work, I present his final film:

98
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,509
a one-minute short about how we feel
when we get up in the morning

99
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:24,509
This is Ohayou

100
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,689
<i>--Ohayou

101
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,839
Farewell, Satoshi Kon.
