00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,230
Hi my name is Tony
and this is Every Frame a Painting.

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,229
There are some filmmakers
who are so influential

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,540
that no matter where you look,
you see traces of them everywhere.

4
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,560
I see this filmmaker's framing
in the works of Wes Anderson.

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,760
His acrobatics and stunts
in Jackie Chan.

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,760
And his deadpan posture
in Bill Murray.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,430
He, of course, is Buster Keaton,
one of the three great silent comedians

8
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:42,490
"He was, as we’re now
beginning to realize...

9
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,449
...the greatest of all the clowns
in the history of the cinema."

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,300
And nearly a hundred years later

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,120
I think he still has plenty
to teach us about visual comedy.

12
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,320
So today, let’s take a look at
how the master builds a gag.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,440
Ready?

14
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:00,739
Let's go.

15
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,700
The first thing you need to know
about visual comedy

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,370
is that you have to
tell your story through action.

17
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,350
Keaton was a visual storyteller
and he never liked it

18
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,460
when other directors told their story
through the title cards.

19
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,780
-"The average picture used
240 titles...

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,380
"...that was about the average."

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,310
-"240 was the average?"
-"Yes. And the most I ever used was 56"

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,190
He avoided title cards by focusing on
gesture and pantomime.

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,550
In this shot, you never find out
what these two are talking about.

24
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,419
Everything you need to know is conveyed
through the table & their body language

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,900
"But what you had to say...

26
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,490
"You had to communicate
to the audience in only one way..."

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,219
-"Through action"
-"Right. We eliminated subtitles..."

28
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:51,610
"...just as fast as we could
if we could possibly tell it in action"

29
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,420
Keaton believed that each gesture
you did should be unique.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,300
Never do the same thing twice.

31
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,700
Every single fall...

32
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,100
is an opportunity…

33
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,800
for creativity.

34
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,590
But once you know the action
we come to the second problem:

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,550
Where do you put the camera?

36
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,549
Visual gags generally work best
from one particular angle.

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,350
And if you change the angle...

38
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,769
then you’re changing the gag
and it might not work as well.

39
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:29,750
Finding the right angle
is a matter of trial and error.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,380
So let’s take a look at two possible
camera placements for the same joke.

41
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,000
Here’s the first one.

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,000
And here’s the second.

43
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,730
You’ll notice in first angle,
the car takes up most of the frame

44
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,240
and we don’t get a clear look at Buster
until he turns around.

45
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,480
But in the second angle,
the car’s placed in the background

46
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,560
and we always have
a clear view of his face.

47
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,600
This split second, where he doesn’t know
what’s happening but we do...

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,550
...that’s much better from over here.

49
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,800
And in the first angle,
the framing splits our attention.

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,510
Our eyes want to look at his face
and the sign at the same time.

51
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,700
But after reframing the scene...

52
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,489
Our eyes naturally look at him...

53
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,500
then the sign

54
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,529
then back to him.
Much better.

55
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,130
Now we come to the third question...

56
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,730
What are the rules of
this particular world?

57
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,190
Buster’s world is flat
and governed by one law.

58
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,000
If the camera can’t see it,
then the characters can’t see it either.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
In Buster’s world, the characters are
limited by the sides of the frame

60
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,000
and by what’s visible to us,
the audience.

61
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,200
And this allows him to do jokes
that make sense visually

62
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,230
but not logically.

63
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,620
A lot of his gags are about
human movement in the flat world.

64
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,600
He can go to the right...

65
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,500
to the left...

66
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
up...

67
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
down...

68
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,200
away from the lens...

69
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,500
or towards it.

70
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,000
Look familiar?

71
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,000
-"She’s been murdered.
And you think I did it."

72
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,100
-"Hey!"

73
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,210
Like Wes Anderson,
Buster Keaton found humor in geometry.

74
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,510
He often placed the camera further back
so you could see the shape of a joke.

75
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,960
There are circles...

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
triangles...

77
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,260
parallel lines...

78
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,560
and of course, the shape
of the frame itself: the rectangle.

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,159
I think staging like this is great
because it encourages the audience

80
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,700
to look around the frame
and see the humor for themselves.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,500
In this shot, think about
where your eyes are looking.

82
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,320
Now where’s he?

83
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,229
Some of these gags
have their roots in vaudeville

84
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,639
and are designed
to play like magic tricks.

85
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,100
And like all great magic tricks

86
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,800
part of the fun is
trying to guess how it was done.

87
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,250
Keaton had a name for gags like these.
He called them “impossible gags.”

88
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,350
They're some of his
most inventive and surreal jokes.

89
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,669
But as a storyteller,
he found them tricky

90
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:34,200
because they broke
the rules of his world.

91
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:39,109
-"We had to stop doing impossible gags,
what we call cartoon gags."

92
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,599
-"We lost all of that when
we started making feature pictures."

93
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,400
-"They had to be believable
or your story wouldn’t hold up."

94
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,479
So instead, he focused on
what he called the natural gag.

95
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,650
The joke that emerges organically
from the character and the situation.

96
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
Consider what he does with this door.

97
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,600
Keaton claimed that for visual comedy...

98
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,300
you had to keep yourself
open to improvisation.

99
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,900
-"How much of it was planned and
how much came out in the actual doing?"

100
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,700
-"How much was improvised, you know?"

101
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,200
-"Well as a rule, about 50 percent…"

102
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,550
-"...you have in your mind
before you start the picture..."

103
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,549
-"...and the rest you develop
as you’re making it."

104
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,500
Sometimes he would
find a joke he liked so much

105
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,000
that he would do a callback to it later.

106
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,479
But other times, jokes that he’d planned
beforehand wouldn’t work on the day.

107
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,590
So he would just get rid of them...

108
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,270
-"...because they don’t stand up
and they don’t work well."

109
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,700
-"And then the accidental ones come."

110
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,400
He was supposed to make this jump.

111
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
But since he missed...

112
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,300
He decided to keep the mistake
and build on it.

113
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,300
-"So you seldom got a scene like that
good the second time."

114
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,520
-"You generally got em that first one."

115
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,870
-"Maybe that’s one of the reasons..."

116
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,500
-"...there was so much laughter
in the house the other night."

117
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,360
-"I mean, the younger people
and I had this feeling..."

118
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,850
-"...that what we were seeing
was happening now."

119
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,000
-"That it had happened only once..."

120
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,300
-"...It was not something that was
pre-done and done and done."

121
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,320
And that brings us to the last thing
about Buster Keaton

122
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,000
and his most famous rule.

123
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,700
Never fake a gag.

124
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,000
For Keaton, there was only
one way to convince the audience...

125
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,550
...that what they were seeing was real.

126
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,350
He had to actually do it…

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,500
...without cutting.

128
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,780
He was so strict about this
that he once said...

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,780
“Either we get this in one shot…

130
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,760
...or we throw out the gag."

131
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,480
And it’s why he remains vital
nearly 100 years later.

132
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,290
Not just for his skill
but for his integrity.

133
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,290
That’s really him.

134
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,700
And no advancement in technology
can mimic this.

135
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,540
Even now, we’re amazed
when filmmakers actually do it for real.

136
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,400
But I think he did it better
95 years ago.

137
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,350
So no matter how many times...

138
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,200
you’ve seen someone else
pay homage to him…

139
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:18,379
Nothing beats the real thing.
